    "content_text": "Hordes of cannibalistic jellyfish are spreading through Venice’s famed lagoon and wreaking havoc on local fisheries. Usually found in the western Atlantic, the warty comb jellyfish, also known as the sea walnut, is now thriving in the Adriatic Sea.\nDespite its name and appearance, Mnemiopsis leidyi is not a true jellyfish but a comb jelly, which is in a different phylum than true jellyfish. Among other differences, the gelatinous, translucent creatures do not have stingers. The name “comb jellies” comes from their method of moving through the water using rows of hair-like structures called ciliary combs.\nScientists believe the species came to the Adriatic accidentally in the ballast water of cargo ships. A sometime cannibal, it will eat its own young when food is scarce. The bizarre creature has a temporary anus that appears only when it needs to expel waste, then vanishes again. Unfortunately, it is also one of the world’s top invasive species and is causing chaos for the Italian city’s fragile lagoon ecosystem.\nWarm lagoon, happy jellyfish\nThe lagoon is almost perfectly suited to its needs, allowing the sea walnuts population to explode at an alarming rate. A recent two-year study found that it can thrive in a wide range of temperatures and salinity levels. The species blooms from early spring through to early autumn, when warmer waters and stable salt levels allow it to reproduce rapidly. Researchers note that climate change is fueling the jellyfish’s success in the lagoon and that the situation is likely to worsen.\nThe sea walnut may sound harmless, or even cute, but that is far from the truth. The species devours plankton, fish eggs, and fish larvae, stripping the lagoon of the foundations of its food web. For local fishers, the invasion is already having serious consequences. The gelatinous creatures are clogging up fishing nets, making them heavier, harder to haul in, and less effective. At the same time, fish stocks are crashing because the comb jellies are demolishing most of their fish eggs and larvae."

Here are some of the best adventure links we’ve discovered this week.\nThe Strange Brain of the World’s Greatest Solo Climber: After his recent ground-breaking, ropeless climb up a 101-story building, we look back on an article written about Alex Honnold 10 years ago. Famed for his free soloing, he takes on feats that would terrify other people. Neuroscientists were convinced Honnold’s amygdala was not firing properly, and he agreed to a set of brain scans. This article explores his extraordinary brain and why Honnold can tackle life-threatening ascents with remarkable calm.\nMore recently, Honnold himself addressed the amygdala question:\nFirst Ascent of ‘Out of the Dark’: Mountain guides Simon Gietl and Vittorio Messini have made the first ascent of Out of the Dark on the formidable north face of Laserz Peak in the Lienz Dolomites. They describe the 270m route as “winter climbing with an interesting mixed and ice section in the last third.”\nThe kindness of strangers\nWe left Everything to Cycle the World: Bernardo Bacalhau and Jule Noah set out from Singapore in early 2025. They planned to spend the next year, or possibly longer, cycling back to Portugal. However, the trip ended unexpectedly after three months on the road. Bacalhau has created a one-hour video about the journey, and the pair discusses a particular day in Thailand when they learned to accept the kindness of strangers.\nGreatest Whitewater Descents of the Century (So Far): With the help of some of the world’s best kayakers and canoeists, here is a list of the best whitewater descents since the year 2000.\nFrom the first descent of Tibet’s Tsangpo Gorge and ground-breaking journeys down Africa’s Congo and Lukuga rivers, to a historic source-to-sea paddle on the Amazon and remote whitewater in Papua New Guinea, each expedition highlights modern paddlers pushing the boundaries of their sport.\nThe Walker Who Climbed his 1,000th Hill at 73: In 2024, veteran hillwalker Jeff Kent climbed Roseberry Topping in Yorkshire, his 1,000th hill in England. He has had a lifelong passion for walking and spent much of his time mapping England’s lesser-known peaks.\nKent has compiled a comprehensive list of England’s 3,805 hills between 1,000 and 1,999 feet (300m-610m). He discusses naming the list in honor of his parents and the years he spent documenting and climbing.\nThe Sycamore Gap\nIf a Tree Falls: In 2023, Adam Carruthers and Daniel Graham cut down the iconic Sycamore Gap tree at Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland. Sitting in a dip in the landscape, the tree was a beloved spot for photographers and hikers, and even featured in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\nThe pair cut the tree down with a chainsaw in the dead of night, and it soon made national news. Their actions led to a criminal trial, and across the country, people spoke of their devastation that the tree had been cut down. This journalist attends the trial to figure out why the tree’s destruction inspired so much emotion.\nThe Path of Least Resistance: Aaron Rolph writes about his 700km e-bike journey across the Balkans. Rolph and two friends started in Montenegro and made their way across Kosovo and Albania, testing the limits of their battery-assisted bikes along backcountry trails, up steep climbs, and through national parks.\nSurviving on a remote island\nMeet 13 People Who Survived on Deserted Islands: Here are seven true stories of 13 castaways who found themselves completely isolated on various islands around the world. From Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who inspired the classic novel Robinson Crusoe, to a group of Tongan teens who survived for over a year on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and an Iñupiat seamstress who spent two years stuck on Wrangel Island above the Arctic Circle."

    "content_text": "Over 100 Sessions Later, Nathan Williams Tops His First V17\nWilliams is the latest to repeat Daniel Woods' Return of the Sleepwalker V17\nNathan Williams has just announced his send of Return of the Sleepwalker V17 (9A) in Red Rock, Nevada. In his own words, it was a battle, spending over 100 sessions to unlock the problem. He sent Sleepwalker V15/16 back in December 2020, but didn’t try ROTSW, the sit-start version of Sleepwalker, until 2022.\nSleepwalker was put up by Jimmy Webb in 2018. A few years later, Daniel Woods established ROTSW in March 2021. Woods’ first ascent was historic, as ROTSW became the first V17 in the United States. Will Bosi made the second ascent in February of 2024. Noah Wheeler then made the third ascent in December that year.\n“The epic battle is over, I just didn’t want the boulder to win,” said Williams on Instagram. “When I first tried this boulder in 2022 the shoulder method for the bottom was the only beta that had been done. In later seasons, easier beta was found for the bottom, and while it made climbing through the bottom consistent and faster, it felt wrong—it was tweaky on my wrist and not the original challenge I sought out to complete. Last season, I barely had any desire to try it because I hated the new beta for the bottom. This year, I chose to switch back to the shoulder beta. While more physically difficult, the original beta was a more enjoyable experience for me and was exactly the challenge I had dedicated myself to throughout the previous years.”\nROTSW saw a lot of action in 2025. Simon Lorenzi, Ryuichi Murai, Zach Galla, and Adam Shahar made the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh ascents, respectively. With Williams’ send, ROTSW has now seen a total of eight ascents, making it the most repeated V17 in the world. Alphane has six ascents, Burden of Dreams and Soudain Seul have five, and Shaolin has four. All other V17s either remain unrepeated or have only seen one repeat.\nBefore ROTSW, Williams’ hardest send was Daniel Woods’ Creature from the Black Lagoon V16 in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, which he topped in September 2024. He sent Sleepwalker V15/16 at the end of 2020. He has lots of other hard boulders to his name, including The Wheel of Wolvo V14 at Lincoln Lake, Colorado, Brass Knuckles V14 in Dayton Pocket, Tennessee, and Esperanza V14 in Hueco Tanks, among others."
