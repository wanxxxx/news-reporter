The Simulator took the climbing world by storm, and Metolius has been on the cutting edge of the finger training game ever since, offering several other training tools in wood and plastic, both mountable and portable. Their latest offering is their lightweight Nano Rings – portable wooden blocks you can take to the gym or crag.</p>\n<p>The Nano Rings are sold individually or as a package of two. Each block features 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm edges, a 40 mm finger jug and a 40 mm full hand jug. You can use them for weighted lifts at the gym on any size edge you would like to train. They&#8217;re also great for some simple finger rolls and tugs as you are warming up, either for a gym session or at the crag. When using the rings as a pair, they easily do the trick for any hanging exercise you can think of.</p>\n<p>Each block weighs 220 g (the weight of approximately three Clif Bars), making the Nano Rings a very portable companion. With dimensions of 35 mm x 80 mm x 40 mm, you don&#8217;t have to agonize over whether or not to pack it on even the most heinous slog to your climbing destination of choice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0851-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66604\" height=\"1917\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0851-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<p>With these weight and size specs, the Nano Rings are a little heavier and bulkier than some other wood blocks on the market, but they sturdy and designed to last. They are thick enough that you will never be afraid of the wood splintering as you train weighted lifts. And because the wood itself is robust, you would never pick them up and be concerned that they&#8217;re too flimsy to withstand your training protocol or that they might get crushed under the weight of your gear.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think the Nano Rings are awesome. They&#8217;re a great design, balancing functionality, portability, and comfort. The wood is not too slippery, nor too rough, and the finish doesn&#8217;t immediately make your fingers sweat, as some other finishes do. I love having a large variety of edges on such a small device. The choice by Metolius to make the edges slightly positive is genius. When hung in open space, portable blocks tend to tilt under the weight of the climber. However, the slightly positive angle means that the edges will still sit horizontally, instead of slightly tipping downward and creating impossible-to-hold slimpers as you hang. I don&#8217;t notice the slightly positive angle bothering me with weighted lifts – the edges feel comfortable and safe to train on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0852-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66605\" height=\"1864\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0852-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<p>The jugs are also great for all of your needs: deadhangs, shoulder shrugs, pullups, front levers, whatever you can think of (or are capable of). Some jugs on other portable wood blocks or hangboards are uncomfortable. They can be angular, too skinny, or sometimes feature unusual notches and lines, all of which can create hot spots when you hang. It can be frustrating when you&#8217;re trying to rehabilitate an injury, but the hot spot aggravates your already irritated <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[insert injured body part here].</span> But like the edges, the jugs are pleasantly ergonomic and comfortable.</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re in the market for a new portable training blocks that meets the Goldilocks standard of comfort, affordability, packability, durability, these Nano Rings are for you. Their thoughtful composition by Metolius makes them tools you will actually want to take with you to the crag and use as a part of your training routine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0844-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66600\" height=\"752\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0844-2.jpg\" width=\"1035\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLsUWoSMiQV/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> </p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/gear/metolius-nano-rings-a-review/\">Metolius Nano Rings: A Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

Mirosław intends for this final event of the season, in her home country, to be her last. No doubt, climbers are looking forward to embracing one final season with Mirosław, who has done so much for the sport of speed climbing.</p>\n<p>Mirosław has set multiple speed climbing world records, often breaking her own. She was the climber to establish the inaugural women&#8217;s Olympic Record in Tokyo at 6.97 seconds, and in the finals, set a new record of 6.84 seconds. In May 2022, she broke her world record and established a new one of 6.53 seconds at a qualification round at the World Cup in Salt Lake City, Utah. In April 2023, she shaved 0.28 more seconds off at the World Cup in Seoul, South Korea, resulting in a new record of 6.25 seconds. And in the European Qualifier for the Paris Olympics in September 2023, she took took her record down to 6.24 seconds.</p>\n<p>Her latest record breaker was at the qualification heats in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, when she climbed the speed route in only 6.06 seconds. At the games, not only did she set a new world record standard, but she also took home the Olympic Gold medal in speed climbing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today is my 32nd birthday,&#8221; said Mirosław on Instagram. &#8220;For me, it’s a moment to pause for a second, a time for reflection and for looking back at the road I’ve travelled. And I think this day will stay with me forever, because today I want to share something very important with you. This idea first appeared in my heart many years ago and has been slowly growing ever since. For a long time, I knew how I wanted to say goodbye to the world of sport in this role. On top. On my own terms. My own way. And now, as I turn 32, that day has come.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’d like to tell you that the 2026 season will be my last competitive season in the World Cup and European Championships. Just a few final starts and then this chapter comes to a close. Sport will always remain an important part of who I am, even though my role will gradually change. There will be time to tell that story. Today’s announcement is mainly for you — for the fans who have been with me all these years. Ahead of me are the final months, competitions and training sessions, and my commitment to the work I still have to do remains unchanged. So do my goals. I’m giving this everything I have.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Here, I’d like to invite you to join me in this final chapter and especially to Kraków, where I’ll compete in the World Cup for the last time. I don’t know how this stage will end, because in sport there are no guarantees, but I’ll do everything I can to finish it in the best way I know how.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mb-8 lg:mb-10\">\n<div class=\"story__part mb-8 lg:mb-10\">\n<div class=\"d3-markdown \">\n<div class=\"\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUQdzXtDSx0/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> </p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/olympic-gold-medallist-climber-announces-retirement/\">Olympic Gold Medallist Climber Announces Retirement</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

Or a stolen beloved mini-problem?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a video of a pro climber’s attempt on Return of the Sleepwalker, running water could be heard in the background. According to some, that sound is a cue precipitation recently occurred in that area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was also a reported send of that iconic V17 boulder on a date last year that was concerningly soon after a major rainfall event in Red Rocks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It sparked off a conversation about the ethics of climbing after a bout of wet weather, and many raised concerns that this would increase the risk of damage to the boulder, while also setting a bad precedent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sandstone can become pliable in wet weather. Luckily, in the case of Return, there has been no reported damage. However, many climbers in areas like Red Rocks have an understanding that no one is to pull on holds until a sufficient amount of time has passed after rain or flood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this norm hasn’t already been broken, it likely will only be a matter of time. Athletes, especially those pressured by sponsors and career prospects, travel from around the world to try the problem. At some point, the gains of sending a V17 are bound to outweigh the personal cost of climbing a damp rock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also a number of other contributing factors that could make Return of the Sleepwalker particularly susceptible to wear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jerry Handren, the author of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red Rocks: A Climber’s Guide</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, said Return of the Sleepwalker is in an area that’s easy to access and sees a lot of traffic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He didn’t have a traffic count for the iconic V17 specifically, but he told Gripped that it’s in a heavily-frequented area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s busy. Lots of people bouldering in that zone these days. Seems like there’s always someone there,” said Handren.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s] a 20-minute hike, 15-minute drive along a dirt road. Probably takes an hour to get from I-15 or the [Las Vegas] strip to the start of the dirt road most days.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also noted that climbing wet rock has generally been an ongoing problem in Red Rocks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has led to man-made erosion on a number of climbs, changing the difficulty level both up and down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some routes get harder because chip edges lose their lips and get more rounded. This happens for cutter edges as well. Slopers often get more positive over time, a process that accelerates with brushing and accelerates even more with brushing in damp conditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, he noted there might actually be an incentive to climb in wet conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Red Rocks slopers are very condition-dependent, and, in some cases, are easier to stick after rain,” he said. “The dry, windy conditions that work for granite, for example, can make some Red Rocks slopers impossible to stick.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Return of the Sleepwalker features an incredibly difficult sloper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are just some examples of how problems can change over time thanks to erosion and traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what happens when boulders disappear altogether? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Squamish, Portable, a mini-boulder problem, went missing in September last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one-foot tall hunk of granite was beloved, and many were outraged at its disappearance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, it re-emerged in Bishop in January. This extended absence raised questions about how it could or should be preserved in case of a not-so-lucky next time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One answer could lie with technological innovation. 3D printing has advanced to a point where professionals have been able to train on replicas of benchmark problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps such replicas could also be used to preserve the original shape and form of problems for future generations.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can the ‘Burden of Dreams’ approach to 3D printing preserve Return of the Sleepwalker?</span></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66572\" style=\"width: 812px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Burden-of-dreams.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66572\" height=\"917\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Burden-of-dreams.jpg\" width=\"812\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66572\">The holds scanned for the Burden of Dreams replica. Photo Credit: Core Climbing</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Will Bosi sent Burden of Dreams, it was a landmark in the history of the sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only because it was a big send of a benchmark V17, but because of the method that Bosi employed. He had the ability to train on 3D printed holds that replicated the problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could a model like that apply to something like Return of the Sleepwalker?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I believe it’s really dependent on the style of boulder problem,” Bosi told Gripped. “Lines like Burden are far easier to replicate and preserve than lines like Return of the Sleepwalker. However, I do still believe it would be possible to replicate most boulders, but far more work would be needed, along with custom wall design.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A problem like Burden lent itself very well to becoming a replica. It’s almost like a board climb, with a consistent angle. Making a facsimile of this climb was mainly a process of replicating individual holds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of Burden, Bosi’s ability to train with replica holds was the result of work done by Aidan Roberts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, Roberts scanned the holds of the problem. It was then 3D printed by someone from Germany. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But 3D prints alone typically aren’t enough. They have a tendency to be weak and slippy, often making them unsuitable for climbing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, Core Climbing, a UK-based hold manufacturer, then got involved in the process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to create holds that would be well-suited for climbing, castings had to be made. These are holds that are created by pouring material into molds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Core Climbing took the 3D prints, gave them texture and fixation points, and created molds from them to produce finished castings that Bosi then practised on at the Lattice training centre.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bosi has also been able to scan holds for Floatin’, an iconic V16 in Japan. Core also stepped in and manufactured holds for this famous problem, which, along with Burden’s holds, are now available to the public. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Printing individual holds for a board-like problem is one thing, but what about a boulder like Return of the Sleepwalker, which has a much more varied surface?</span></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66573\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CORE-Aidan-Roberts-and-Leo-Moger-Burden-Holds_108.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66573\" height=\"1875\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CORE-Aidan-Roberts-and-Leo-Moger-Burden-Holds_108.jpg\" width=\"2500\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66573\">Left to right, Aidan Roberts and Leo Moger examining replica holds of Burden of Dreams. Photo Credit: Core Climbing</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leo Moger, director at Core Climbing, said that the technology to create carbon copies of entire boulders probably exists, but cost and resources can be a limiting factor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, 3D scans of the boulder have to be made. In some cases, it can be as simple as using a phone app. That’s apparently the approach that Roberts and Bosi took, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may work if the idea is to scan small areas like individual holds. But for bigger jobs that also demand very high resolution, a phone app may not cut it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You would require professional grade scanning equipment to cover a boulder face and actually achieve any sort of detail, and for the hardest lines, the fine detail matters,” Moger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even sophisticated scanners aren’t a guarantee of perfect replicability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even with high-end scanning, there are always tiny details that do not come through cleanly: small divots, crystals, pocket depth, and texture,” said Teresa Coimbra, a Core Climbing staffer who was present during the scanning work for Floatin’.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having the climber who knows the holds well is still important for checking and refining the final result.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with Burden and Floatin’, a 3D model would then have to be printed. The model would then be coated to form a mold, which would then allow for castings to be created.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“An entire boulder face would be quite a challenge, individual holds are of course much easier to do,” said Moger. “For Burden and Floatin’, I needed to mold and cast several times to get the details and texture correct.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the tech is probably already there,” he said. “But the market definitely isn&#8217;t.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a small project could take months to realize, he said, and they don’t recoup the outlay when compared with commercial projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost-wise, a buyer would likely have to drop something that’s easily five figures, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, if a project like this were to happen, here’s one way it could.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“An entire boulder could definitely be scanned to high resolution,” said Moger. &#8220;This way a library of boulders could be created on a computer, individual holds would be easy enough to pick out and 3D print, mold [and] cast.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A full face could be printed with an enormous machine, or in multiple sections. It would then be a matter of replicating the same process used to create individual holds. The final product would need to be a glass-reinforced plastic for weight and strength, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while the shape could be replicated, there is still the question of whether plastic could ever mimic the feel of real rock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step into a climbing gym, and it’s very likely that many of the holds you’ll be pulling on are made from polyurethane, and, occasionally, wood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These, however, are poor substitutes for the real thing, Moger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You would want a material with high abrasion and thermal conductivity to best mimic rock,” he said. “Fortunately, polyester composites are ideal for this. They feel great, cool to touch, and have [a] long-lasting surface. You would still need to select the correct base texture prior to molding the model, but that is fairly straightforward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, this still isn’t rock. Could something more ‘real’ be used when fashioning climbing holds?</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The geologist’s approach: using minerals to 3D print sandstone</span></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66575\" style=\"width: 1136px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Sergey-Ishutov.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66575\" height=\"1599\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Sergey-Ishutov.jpg\" width=\"1136\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66575\">Sergey Ishutov, a geologist, has done extensive work 3D printing rocks with a sand printer. Photo Credit: Sergey Ishutov</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until now, the discussion has largely been centred around the tools and techniques used by the climbing industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But geologists have been applying their own methods in using this technology to reconstruct rocks using materials rocks are literally made from. While this hasn’t been tested for climbing, it doesn’t take a big stretch of the imagination to see how it could easily apply. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps one of the most promising of the tools Serg Ishutov has used in his career as a geologist and researcher is the sand printer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Powder is loaded on top of the printer, which then deposits it in layers of varying thickness onto a flat platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sand is unloaded, bit by bit, while a substance known as a binder is sprinkled on top of each layer. This acts as the glue for the soon-to-be rock. The process repeats with alternating layers of sand and binder until a rock emerges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You print a sandstone,” said Ishutov, an assistant professor at Concordia University of Edmonton. “It really looks like a piece of, you know, pebble that you can find anywhere on the beach.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such equipment, it may be possible to create carbon copies of boulders, he said. However, the caveat is that it depends on the material of the original rock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sandstone boulders would likely be feasible. But a granite problem like Portable would be a challenge, as igneous rocks are much more difficult to reproduce.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are powders that can replicate sand, clay, calcite, those that are coming from the sedimentary rocks,” Ishutov told Gripped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These types of rocks are easier to replicate, because they generally have a primary mineral, often quartz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Igneous rocks, he said, are more of a challenge, because they consist of a greater variety of mineral types.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology for replicating igneous rocks is currently in development and still needs to be streamlined, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, progress is being made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one case, Ishutov said he paid a visit to a company in Belgium that had an instrument that showed some potential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It could mix different powders or different substances to produce multi-material prints,” he recalled. “So let&#8217;s say, if you want to have sandstone within limestone within granite [you could make it]…if you have the right components. So that apparatus may be able to produce it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While igneous rocks may still be a work in progress, making a carbon copy of a giant sandstone boulder may well be within the realm of possibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, with the machines he’s worked with, the dimensions of a sand print are a metre by a metre, though newer technology may have increased the print size.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the process of replicating a sandstone boulder would likely involve printing individual parts of the rock and assembling them together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some machines also have the ability to fortify a printed rock to ensure it has the longest life possible. This would be done by introducing a reinforcing liquid or powder agent into the print.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There haven’t been any studies comparing the durability of 3D printed sandstone to its real counterpart for the use of rock climbing, but it could be a promising proposition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would say that they may be comparable, because…you&#8217;re using this using similar material: [there’s] quartz in the natural sandstone and quartz in the 3D print,” said Ishutov. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only difference is that natural sandstones actually can have various compositions. So in addition to quartz, they can have other minerals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also noted that the composition and properties of sandstone prints could be changed to suit their purpose.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the technology is there, and it could theoretically work. The final big question is cost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ishutov estimated that assembling a 10-foot by 10-foot surface with a thickness of a couple centimetres would cost somewhere in the area of $10,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also depends on whether you own the machine or not. A print could cost anywhere from thousands of dollars if it’s ordered as a service versus hundreds of dollars if you own the equipment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ishutov suggests it would cost over $100,000 to buy something like the sand printer he has used: the ExOne M-Flex.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this model appears to have been discontinued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A representative from ExOne and voxeljet, which are sand printer manufacturers that are undergoing a merger, said a smaller sand printer would cost about 120,000</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">€, or about </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$141,000. A larger, industrial system could cost up to $1.9 million. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a staggering cost, making it unlikely that someone would try this science experiment in the near future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as the sport gets more popular, there may, at some point, be a real demand for preserving its benchmark climbs just as they are now. Some deep-pocketed benefactors or sponsors may deem the cost to be worth it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holds can break and wear out. Access issues may bar some climbs from reach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a digital library of 3D scans of the sport’s most important climbs? That could live forever, waiting for the right time to be printed back into reality. Perhaps a time when technology becomes cheaper. More accessible. Or when the demand becomes most pressing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is some comfort in knowing that, with the right resources, gear, and know-how, someone generations from now may still be able to pull on the holds of a preserved climb, completely unchanged from how it is this moment.</span></p>\n<h3>Watch: A demonstration of a 3D sand printer in an industrial setting.</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/profiles/can-3d-printing-preserve-a-potentially-eroding-v17-boulder-or-a-stolen-beloved-mini-problem/\">Can 3D printing preserve a potentially eroding V17 boulder?

It&#8217;s the 25-year-old&#8217;s first big send since topping two V17s in a week at the beginning of December.</p>\n<p>Lucid Dreaming is a Buttermilks classic, and a sandbag at V15, at least in the modern era of bouldering. The problem features one of hardest two-move sequences of any established line in the world. When Paul Robinson made the first ascent in 2010, he initially proposed V16. After climbing a few other problems, he made the decision to downgrade it to V15 before it received a repeat. Whatever the grade, Lucid Dreaming was a futuristic climb. It took four years for the problem to receive its second ascent, and Daniel Woods was the climber to do it.</p>\n<p>Alex Megos was the third ascensionist, sending the problem in 2015, and he described it at the time as “the longest project I ever had.” He compared the experience of topping out as being similar to when he ascended Action Directe, the world’s first 5.14d. Since Megos’ ascent, Lucid Dreaming has be completed by several of the world’s best climbers, including Jimmy Webb, Sean Bailey, Lee Sungsu, Adam Shahar, Toru Nakajima, and David Fitzgerald, among others. Ethan Salvo recently announced his ascent of the problem, which you can learn more about <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/an-interview-with-ethan-salvo-on-his-ascent-of-the-legendary-lucid-dreaming-v15/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Progress like this feels so good,&#8221; said Galla on Instagram after his ascent. &#8220;Whenever I’ve been in bishop, I would always have to test how I was feeling on Lucid. I sorted out the individual moves fairly quickly but the link always felt too elusive for me to even want to dedicate serious time. This go around I felt much more comfortable in the positions and with a bit of luck was able to lace it up after two short sessions, on my second proper “send try”! This has got to be the most pure testpeice of all time. Feels like a dream.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Galla is one of the strongest boulderers in the game. On December 4, he sent his first of V17, Sean Bailey&#8217;s Shaolin in Red Rock, Nevada. Seven days later, he topped his second of the grade, Woods&#8217; Return of the Sleepwalker, also in Red Rock. In September, he repeated America’s first V16, Woods’ Hypnotized Minds in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. In addition to Hypnotized Minds, he has several absolute classic V16s to his name, including Grand Illusion, Sleepwalker, Sosa, and perhaps most impressively, the long-awaited second ascent of The Process.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DURKYh0kaAd/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> </p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/the-most-pure-testpeice-of-all-time-zach-galla-sends-lucid-dreaming-v15/\">&#8220;The most pure testpeice of all time&#8221; – Zach Galla Sends Lucid Dreaming V15</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

In this case, the Ogre, or Baintha Brakk, proved no exception. Chris Bonington reflected on the fragile balance, noting that on previous expeditions, “friends had lost their lives, all of them at the very end of the expedition.” This time, the team nearly followed the same pattern. It was lighthearted all the way to the top, until Doug Scott slipped. A climb that had seemed a success suddenly became a struggle for survival.</p>\n<p>The expedition was hardly traditional. It resembled an Alpine trip with friends sharing a base and choosing routes as circumstances dictated. Doug Scott, who had initiated the trip, realized seven climbers was too many for a 24,000-foot peak. They split into two groups. Doug and Tut Braithwaite pursued a striking rock prow straight up the center of the mountain. The others, Dougal Haston, Clive Rowland, Mo Anthoine, Charlie Clarke, and Chris, took a more devious, technically easier line to the left. Tragically, Charlie Clarke, who would have served as the team doctor, had to drop out for personal reasons, and Dougal Haston died in a skiing accident in January 1977. Nick Estcourt stepped in to fill the gap.</p>\n<p>The Ogre had already seen three failed attempts. Don Morrison led two expeditions in the 1970s but could not find a viable route up the lower slopes. In 1975, a Japanese team tried from the south, reaching around 21,000 feet but retreating due to weather and time constraints. Bonington’s team reached base camp on June 10, a triangular patch of grass squeezed between moraine and rocky slopes, just minutes from Morrison’s Latok II expedition. The camp’s atmosphere reminded Chris of Chamonix, only surrounded by unclimbed aiguilles.</p>\n<p>Three days later, an Advanced Base was established beneath the Ogre’s southern face. Here, the routes diverged. Doug and Tut ferried gear for an alpine push to the col at the foot of their prow, while the others, jokingly called the B team, planned to fix ropes to a spur leading to a different col before continuing alpine-style. Early days saw Chris, Nick, Mo, and Clive working together on the spur. “We had all underestimated its scale,” Chris recalled. What seemed like a two-day effort ended up taking nine days to fix ropes and establish a camp at the arête’s top.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ogre-team.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66553\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ogre-team.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a></p>\n<p>Their first setback came on June 18 when a loose rock struck Tut Braithwaite’s thigh as he and Doug carried loads. Luckily, it did not break, but it was badly bruised, forcing Doug to ferry loads alone. Meanwhile, the B team progressed steadily along their spur, negotiating short rocky steps, gullies, and snow slopes that would later turn to ice. Nick and Chris reached their ridge camp on June 20 after hauling fifty-pound loads of food meant to last ten days.</p>\n<p>The team dynamics were different. Mo and Clive preferred a steadier pace with more rest, while Nick and Chris pushed on aggressively. The group reunited at Camp II on June 21, reinforcing the camaraderie despite differing strategies. From there, progress continued, culminating in the thrill of reaching the broad glaciated shoulder leading to the Ogre’s final mass. At 21,000 feet, level with the Baintha Aiguilles and just below Conway’s Ogre, they gazed over a panorama of unnamed, unclimbed peaks and, in the distance, the massive Nanga Parbat. Chris remembered feeling “released from all external pressures, dependent on each other alone, committed to the seemingly simple objective of the Ogre.”</p>\n<p>On June 27, they dug a snow hole at 21,800 feet, preparing for the final push. Crossing ice-covered slabs required precarious tension traverses. Chris muttered protests while Nick urged him on, reminding him that if he backed down, Nick would have to take the lead. The bivvy was harsh. Chris remained dry under his Gortex outer, but Nick’s sleeping bag became damp from condensation. The mountain demanded every ounce of focus, endurance, and nerve.</p>\n<p>Despite careful planning, the Ogre proved as formidable as expected. Each snow slope, rock step, and ridge demanded painstaking effort. Bonington’s account captures not just the physical struggle but the emotional tightrope that Himalayan climbers navigate, where exhilaration and peril exist side by side.</p>\n<p>The following morning, the team began traversing toward the Ogre’s main peak. The closer they got, the more forbidding it appeared. Back at Advanced Base and on the shoulder, they had convinced themselves that the final rock tower must have lines of weakness, “perhaps around the back somewhere.” They could not believe that a 23,900-foot summit had no comparatively straightforward way to the top. In hindsight, their preparation had been minimal: only fifteen rock pegs, no étriers, and very few slings. Now, the monolithic face before them made even reaching the little col below the summit block daunting.</p>\n<p>They were almost at the col between the west summit and the main summit. Just 300 feet below the top, yet those 300 feet consisted of steep, technically difficult rock at nearly 24,000 feet. It was past midday when the idea came to both of them simultaneously. The west summit, about 200 feet lower than the main, had an easy snow slope leading up to it. With only one cylinder of gas, a day’s worth of food, and insufficient hardware, they decided to secure a summit by taking the easier route. That afternoon, they dug a snow hole and reached the west summit the next morning, descending afterward to the shoulder. They had made the sensible choice, yet a gnawing sense of anti-climax lingered. The solid lump of the Ogre’s main summit still haunted them.</p>\n<p>Concerns about the others weighed heavily. Why had they not come up? Reversing the traverse the following morning provided the answer. At the broad col below the end of the traverse, they found Mo, Clive, Tut, and Doug. Each party had worried about the other but had decided to pursue their own route when rescue seemed impossible. Clive had favored the steep rocks of the west ridge, arguing it was both safer and more interesting. Doug agreed, abandoning his rock prow because Tut’s leg was still problematic. Fortuitously, they found about a thousand feet of Japanese fixed rope, greatly aiding their climb.</p>\n<p>Tragically, bad news arrived. It was not their team that had been delayed, it was a tragedy in the Latok II expedition. Don Morrison had fallen into a crevasse and died.</p>\n<p>The discussion turned to logistics. Their pile of food mirrored what Chris and Nick had carried, barely enough for a summit push. If they could persuade the others to descend for more supplies, a renewed summit attempt could be possible. Eventually, the plan was agreed upon. The party returned to Base Camp, and two days later, Clive, Mo, and Doug began ascending again. Chris and Nick rested for two days, though both were exhausted and Nick struggled with a severely infected throat.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66554\" style=\"width: 450px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Clive.jpg\"><img alt=\"Clive Owens.

Photo by Doug Scott</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On July 5, the climb resumed. The day was spent at Advanced Base retrieving the gear and food Doug had left on the col. Tut and Nick soon realized they were unfit for another attempt. Chris set out alone in the early hours, undertaking a 13-hour haul to the col with a heavy sack. Meanwhile, the others had moved a tent to the shoulder below the west ridge at 22,500 feet, progressing steadily on the steep rocks. Doug led for two days, tackling VS-standard stretches, while Chris eventually joined them, finding the climbing more relaxed with the fixed ropes in place.</p>\n<p>They faced delays from threatening weather. With one tent for the four climbers, Chris and Mo bivvied under the stars. Doug and Chris descended to the col to retrieve the spare tent. At last, on July 11, the final summit push began. Even then, they underestimated the time needed at altitude. The day’s goal was to reach the snow hole below the west summit, but the team encountered one more hard pitch. Doug led an awkward traverse on steep, precarious ground, while Chris followed, rappelling short sections and occasionally tumbling.</p>\n<p>With fixed ropes and all four climbers together, the mood lightened, but the effort remained punishing. Progress was slow over snow traverses and rock pitches. Doug tackled the final steep wall, smooth but cleft with a thin crack. He ascended methodically, penduluming across the rock to find placements, until finally reaching the small snow shoulder. From there, Chris followed, carrying his sack and relying on Doug’s assistance.</p>\n<p>The final couloir was snow over rock, insubstantial and strength-sapping. Doug led for nearly an hour, with Chris close behind. Then, at seven o’clock on the night of July 13, they stood on the summit of the Ogre. Exhausted and exhilarated, they had conquered one of the world’s most formidable peaks, every grueling step etched into memory.</p>\n<p>The sun had already slipped behind Kunyan Chhish, leaving little time to savor the panorama. The Ogre dominated the Biafo region; K2 loomed as a triangular black silhouette in the far distance, merging with the blue-grey of night, while Nanga Parbat hung against the fading light to the southwest. Glaciers writhed in deep shadow in every direction. Looking down the other side, it was clear they had taken the easiest route to the summit. Yet there was no time for reflection. Chris, tired of being tail-end Charlie, offered to descend first, but Doug, having lingered on the summit for nearly an hour, was eager to move.</p>\n<p>They fixed the rappel rope below the summit. Doug disappeared from sight, heading straight down the headwall and across the shoulder toward the peg at the top of the crack. Chris’s attention was drawn to the surrounding peaks, but a sudden, Tarzan-like yell snapped him back. Doug was nowhere in view. The rope was taut. He had slipped, swinging violently in an involuntary pendulum. Panic rose. “This might well be it,” Chris thought, assessing how to descend a rope under tension. His Jümars’ safety springs had failed, and Doug had none.</p>\n<p>Then came a shout: “I’ve broken my legs.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66552\" style=\"width: 828px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Ogre.jpg\"><img alt=\"Scott after breaking his legs\" class=\"wp-image-66552 size-full\" height=\"1223\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Ogre.jpg\" width=\"828\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66552\">Scott after breaking his legs</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Chris asked if he could take his weight off the rope. There was no reply. After a long pause, the rope slackened. Chris carefully descended and found Doug sitting on a small ledge, secured by a couple of good nut anchors. He realized immediately the severity of the situation. Carrying an incapacitated man over the traverses or back via the west summit was impossible. He reassured Doug they would get him down, silently wondering how.</p>\n<p>Just below them was a small snow spur. Chris rappelled, and Doug followed, sliding on his back and crawling with a rope pull to the platform Chris had dug. That night became the coldest either had endured. With neither food, stove, nor down gear, they spent hours sitting face to face, massaging each other’s toes to stave off frostbite. Doug worried particularly about his legs. Dawn brought only marginal relief, and they began the descent. Chris led, fixing rappels, with Doug following, while they debated their route. Chris favored descending directly via the path he and Nick had taken, leaving Doug at the foot to be collected by Mo and Clive. By digging large bucket steps, Doug managed to crawl to the snow cave, while the others opted to return over the west summit, following familiar terrain.</p>\n<p>Chris spent the remainder of the day semi-comatose, his voice nearly gone. Mo took over caring for Doug’s feet, while clouds crept across the western sky, foreshadowing a storm. That night the weather broke. Spindrift infiltrated their snow hole, covering Mo’s sleeping bag and leaving the team damp and chilled.</p>\n<p>The next morning, they brewed tea and prepared to ascend. Mo and Clive took the lead to fix a rope to the top of the west summit. Doug, on two Jümars, began his laborious ascent, kneeling in the snow and pulling himself upward by sheer strength. He could not follow the previous steps, now filled in by the storm, and relied solely on the rope and the aid of Mo and Clive for the final few feet. Chris followed behind, removing intermediate pegs. What had been a swift climb for Nick and Chris earlier now took six hours for the four men to ascend just 200 feet.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66556\" style=\"width: 800px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DougScottOgre.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66556\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DougScottOgre.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66556\">Scott descending the Ogre</figcaption></figure>\n<p>By midday, Chris reached the summit to find Doug sitting forlornly, while Mo and Clive had already begun descending. Panic flickered briefly at the sense of isolation, but Doug’s shout brought reassurance. Chris rappelled down to Clive, who waited, and Doug followed. At last, they were moving downward, but each rappel was fraught with the fear of a rope jamming. With most pegs left at the top of the rock wall or in Chris’s pack, they had only five rock pegs, a few nuts, and a single ice peg for the remainder of the descent. Every step demanded focus, courage, and a meticulous calculation of risk.</p>\n<p>They followed Mo, searching at the end of each rope-length for the next anchor point, guided by his shouts until they reached the traverse. Mo led superbly across the snow-clad ice, and they abandoned one rope to serve as a handrail for the rest. Clive cut generous bucket steps for Doug, who crawled along with a back rope from Chris.</p>\n<p>By dusk, they reached the site of their previous snow hole atop the rock step. Mo and Chris began enlarging it for four, a slow, exhausting process. Despite their efforts, Mo and Chris ended up exposed to spindrift, their sleeping bags soaked, and by morning Mo had no feeling in either foot.</p>\n<p>The storm raged on. Strengthened by a weak brew of milkless, sugarless tea, they set out again. Mo pushed ahead, Doug belayed between Clive and Chris, crawling along the crest before dropping to the final steep section leading to the fixed ropes. Here, a near-disaster occurred. Mo, on the final rappel, tied off ropes to be recovered later. Doug, unaware of the dangling short end, rappelled off it, shooting down out of control, but miraculously caught the fixed rope without further injury. Chris later suffered a similar scare, plunging twenty feet before the rope stopped him, hitting a rock with a terrifying crunch. Miraculously, he was relatively uninjured, though his left wrist swelled from the impact.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66555\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-03-10.31.25-AM.png\"><img alt=\"Scott on all four during the descent\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66555\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-03-10.31.25-AM.png\" width=\"900\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66555\">Scott on the descent</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Sun briefly broke through the clouds, revealing snow-plastered peaks and the bottom of the pillar where Mo had begun digging out the tents. Doug hauled himself down the final ropes, poised over the bergschrund. Suspended from a single peg, they managed to lower him safely, then followed the short stretch of steep snow to the tents. Exhausted, soaked, but alive, they collapsed, finding a small supply of milk and sugar for a brew.</p>\n<p>The following morning, Chris felt the effects of his fall. Previously energetic, he now felt drained, suspecting pulmonary edema. Despite his concern, the storm raged, delaying their descent across the plateau. On July 19, the weather finally eased. Mo led the descent, followed by Doug, with Clive and Chris bringing up the rear. Chris, weak and light-headed, cleared ropes and carried his heavy sack and 300 feet of rope in slow, painstaking steps. They reached the head of the fixed ropes above the arête, and Mo hauled Chris down the slope while roped together. Once on the dry glacier, they unroped and Mo surged ahead, while Chris staggered behind, resting every fifty paces. By three o’clock, he saw Base Camp, but it was deserted. A note and cache of food revealed that Nick and Tut had been forced to descend due to limited supplies, leaving Mo to race down for help.</p>\n<p>Clive and Doug had arrived at Base the previous night, exhausted and battered. They spent three days waiting, until Nick, with twelve porters, arrived to rescue the party. Doug endured two more cold, uncomfortable days on a makeshift stretcher, while Chris hiked in a daze down the Biafo Glacier. A helicopter evacuation was delayed due to a crash at Skardu, leaving Chris weak and coughing frothy fluid, a sign of pulmonary trouble, but finally, six days later, he was flown to Islamabad, a bearded, filthy skeleton in red silk underpants and a blue sweater, clutching an ice axe and down gear.</p>\n<p>Looking back, the descent overshadowed the climb. It was an epic journey, full of danger, perseverance, and narrow escapes. There was never true despair, though there were moments of terrifying loss of control. Chris admitted worry only after his own fall, but the team had to keep moving. Doug’s own stamina and self-reliance had been crucial; the party’s limited assistance, careful rope management, and ample snow-melting fuel made survival possible. Without liquids, they could have been in serious trouble within five days.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Britain, Chris felt irritation at the media portraying them as “conquerors of the Ogre.” He preferred to think of the mountain as a great, cunning cat: allowing them to climb, playing with them on the descent, and finally letting them escape, mauled but intact, to face other mountains in the future.</p>\n<h2>Doug Scott on Surviving the Himalaya</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sources: American Alpine Journal, Alpinist, <em>The Ogre Biography of a mountain and the dramatic story of the first ascent </em>by Doug Scott.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/profiles/the-climber-who-broke-both-legs-and-crawled-off-a-himalayan-mountain/\">The Climber Who Broke Both Legs and Crawled off a Himalayan Mountain</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

They have already climbed it twice, each time gaining valuable insights that will help them with their single-day push.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first time it took us 19 days, the second time it took us 18 days,&#8221; said Vanhee on social media. &#8220;Now we are trying to get it done in a 24 hour push&#8230; Difficult route finding, questionable rock quality and some wet slabs…. Welcome to Patagonia! 10 hours of climbing with a 1 hour, 30 minute rest on a ledge, we made it to the waterfalls at pitch 14. What an experience climbing through the night in such a wild place. The send wasn’t for that day but it sure was a great recon mission.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 30-pitch South African Route on the east face of the Central Tower of Paine in Chile was first climbed in 1973/74 by South Africans Michael Scott and Richard Smithers at A4/5. Arthur McGarr or the Mountain Club of South Africa, wrote this about the ascent in the <a href=\"https://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12197510100/East-Face-of-the-Central-Tower-of-Paine\"><em>American Alpine Journal</em></a>, &#8220;The east face of the Central Tower must be one of the finest, and most sustained rock routes in the world. The exposure never lets up as it is possible to see the glacier between one’s feet for the entire way up to the summit cone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first free ascent came in February 2009 by Nico Favresse, Sean Villanueva O’Driscoll, and Ben Ditto after 13 days. &#8220;We encountered some amazing free climbing pitches with very sustained climbing mostly in the 5.11 range, almost never below 5.10+,&#8221; said Favresse <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.ca/stories/sports/climbing/nico-sean-ben-free-east-face-central-tower-torres-del-paine/story-19992.html\">here</a> after their climb. &#8220;We estimate the 2 hardest pitches around 7b+/5-12c. One of them is a very pumpy fingertip enduro corner, while the other is a face climbing boulder problem with a spectacular sequence using a crystalline pocket. We added one bolt to protect this free variation (away from the aid line). Another main free crux of the route is a mega sustained steep 5.11+ offwidth, which was very run out with the only number 6# Camelot we had. Three of the pitches were redpointed after the summit due to icy conditions.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 2023, Tyler Karow, Cedar Christensen, and Imanol Amundarian repeated the South African Route. “We managed to summit on day eight in perfect weather and sent the final crux on day nine in the rain,” said Karow (story <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/south-african-route-30-pitch-5-12c-repeated-in-patagonia/\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Both Caldwell and Vahnee have made history in Patagonia before. In 2024, Vanhee made the first free ascent of Riders on the Storm with Villanueva O’Driscoll and Favresse (story <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/riders-on-the-storm-in-torres-del-paine-freed/\">here</a>). And in 2014, Caldwell and Alex Honnold completed the first ascent of the Fitz Traverse (VI 5.11d C1), which they received a Piolet d&#8217;Or for (story <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/major-patagonia-traverse-completed-by-honnold-and-caldwell/\">here</a>).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DULjhj0jeTa/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> </p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/tommy-caldwell-and-siebe-vanhee-take-on-a-patagonia-big-wall-challenge/\">Tommy Caldwell and Siebe Vanhee Take on a Patagonia Big Wall Challenge</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

His line is called Full Gem, and it goes at V16 (8C+). Full Gem is a sit-start version of Forgotten Gem V15, a climb Užnik almost flashed last  January, but ultimately got on his second go. The send of Full Gem comes just barely one year after the V17 climber first tried it, as he explains below, and marks his third V16.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What a day out in Chironico, finally wrapping up this project,&#8221; said Užnik on Instagram. &#8220;I did Forgotten Gem almost exactly a year ago, and in the same session started working on the sit start. It adds a couple of quite basic but hard moves that make the whole line significantly harder. Such a special moment when everything clicked!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Forgotten Gem was established in February 2022 by Kim Marschner. The following month, Aidan Roberts and Yannick Flohé made the second and third ascent, respectively, on the same day. Will Bosi, Nico Perlorson, and Zach Galla are among the other top climbers to tick the line. The problem ascends a stunning, sheer face etched with little edges, which make for heinous crimps.</p>\n<p>Užnik has been taking down V15 with progressive ease over the last couple of years. His built a solid <a href=\"https://www.8a.nu/user/nicolai-uznik-mv2g2/bouldering\">climbing pyramid</a>, with a robust foundation of V14s and V15s. He now has three V16s under his belt, including his FA of Full Gem. In March 2023, he made the first post-break ascent of Emotional Landscapes V16 in Maltatal, which was V15 before the breakage. He also climbed Bosi&#8217;s Brain Rot V16 in November 2025, and while he said it was likely V15, he still took the grade, but dubbed it soft.</p>\n<p>In October last year, he climbed his first V17 when he made the first ascent of Mount Doom V17 in Maltatal, Austria. A low start to the popular Hide and Sick V14, his ascent of Mount Doom made Užnik one of eight climbers to join<a href=\"https://gripped.com/profiles/can-you-guess-how-many-v17s-sends-there-were-in-2025-hint-it-was-the-most-ever/\"> the V17 club</a> in 2025. Jakob Schubert made the second ascent of Mount Doom in November 2025, confirming the grade. This month, Užnik tested his strength on a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoilH59oHPg\">Burden of Dreams V17</a> replica in preparation for an upcoming trip to Finland to session the real thing.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DUJGh7eCEfa/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> </p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Kim Marschner First Ascent of Forgotten Gem V15</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/switzerland-has-a-new-v16-with-nicolai-uzniks-full-gem/\">Switzerland Has a New V16 with Nicolai Užnik&#8217;s Full Gem</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

Hall had fallen ill with a form of altitude sickness, likely cerebral edema, which caused hallucinations and severe confusion.</p>\n<p>Reports indicate that his Sherpa guides attempted to rescue him for hours, but as night fell, their oxygen supplies ran low and snow blindness set in. Ultimately the team left Hall, who appeared to be dead, and returned to camp. A statement was later issued to inform his friends and family that he had died.</p>\n<p>Twelve hours later, Hall was found alive by a team of climbers, Daniel Mazur, <a href=\"https://andrewbrash.com/about\">Andrew Brash</a>, Myles Osborne, and Jangbu Sherpa, just below the Second Step. He was partially clothed, without oxygen, food, or water, sitting near a 10,000-foot drop. Despite frostbite and confusion, he was alive and coherent enough to respond to them.</p>\n<p>Osborne described the scene just below the Second Step to Everest News in the story &#8220;Update: Myles Osborne for SummitClimb Everest Tibet, Dispatch 28th May 2006&#8221;: &#8220;Sitting to our left, about two feet from a 10,000 foot drop, was a man. Not dead, not sleeping, but sitting cross legged, in the process of changing his shirt. He had his down suit unzipped to the waist, his arms out of the sleeves, was wearing no hat, no gloves, no sunglasses, had no oxygen mask, regulator, ice axe, oxygen, no sleeping bag, no mattress, no food nor water bottle. &#8216;I imagine you&#8217;re surprised to see me here&#8217;, he said. Now, this was a moment of total disbelief to us all. Here was a gentleman, apparently lucid, who had spent the night without oxygen at 8600m, without proper equipment and barely clothed. And ALIVE???&#8221;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66529\" style=\"width: 931px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-02-11.11.37-AM.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66529\" height=\"466\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-02-11.11.37-AM.png\" width=\"931\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66529\">Lincoln Hall on Everest</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A rescue effort later described as &#8220;unprecedented in scale&#8221; quickly swung into action. Mazur and the others bailed on their summit attempt to stay with Hall. At the same time, expedition leader Alexander Abramov sent a team of 12 Sherpa guides from base camp.</p>\n<p>Hall was carefully brought down, walking the final stretch to Everest’s North Col, where he was treated by Russian doctor Andrey Selivanov. He reached Advanced Base Camp the following day, still suffering from frostbite and the effects of cerebral edema. Hall ultimately lost the tips of several fingers and a toe to frostbite.</p>\n<p>His survival and rescue occurred shortly after the death of British climber David Sharp on Everest. Sharp had been left unattended while unconscious but alive, as others continued their ascents. The incidents sparked international concern, including from Sir Edmund Hillary, and a mention in the book <em>High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed</em>.</p>\n<p>Mazur said after the rescue, &#8220;The summit is still there and we can go back. Lincoln only has one life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2006, the documentary Left for Dead on Mount Everest aired on Dateline NBC and was nominated for an Emmy Award. Hall also authored two books about his ordeal: <em>Dead Lucky: Life after Death on Mount Everest</em> (2007) and <em>Alive in the Death Zone: Mount Everest Survival</em> (2008). Another documentary, Miracle on Everest, based on Dead Lucky, premiered in 2008 on the National Geographic Channel. Hall died in 2012 at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia, after battling mesothelioma.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66530\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lincoln-Hall.jpg\"><img alt=\"Hall after the rescue\" class=\"wp-image-66530 size-full\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lincoln-Hall.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66530\">Hall after the rescue</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Dan Mazur Talks About the Day</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/profiles/the-rescue-of-a-climber-left-for-death-on-mount-everest-20-years-ago/\">The Rescue of a Climber Left for Death on Mount Everest 20 Years Ago</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

In his own words, it was a battle, spending over 100 sessions to unlock the problem. He sent Sleepwalker V15/16 back in December 2020, but didn&#8217;t try ROTSW, the sit-start version of Sleepwalker, until 2022.</p>\n<p>Sleepwalker was put up by Jimmy Webb in 2018. A few years later, Daniel Woods established ROTSW in March 2021. Woods&#8217; first ascent was historic, as ROTSW became the first V17 in the United States. Will Bosi made the second ascent in February of 2024. Noah Wheeler then made the third ascent in December that year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The epic battle is over, I just didn’t want the boulder to win,&#8221; said Williams on Instagram. &#8220;When I first tried this boulder in 2022 the shoulder method for the bottom was the only beta that had been done. In later seasons, easier beta was found for the bottom, and while it made climbing through the bottom consistent and faster, it felt wrong—it was tweaky on my wrist and not the original challenge I sought out to complete. Last season, I barely had any desire to try it because I hated the new beta for the bottom. This year, I chose to switch back to the shoulder beta. While more physically difficult, the original beta was a more enjoyable experience for me and was exactly the challenge I had dedicated myself to throughout the previous years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>ROTSW saw a lot of action in 2025. Simon Lorenzi, Ryuichi Murai, Zach Galla, and Adam Shahar made the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh ascents, respectively. With Williams&#8217; send, ROTSW has now seen a total of eight ascents, making it the most repeated V17 in the world. Alphane has six ascents, Burden of Dreams and Soudain Seul have five, and Shaolin has four. All other V17s either remain unrepeated or have only seen one repeat.</p>\n<p>Before ROTSW, Williams&#8217; hardest send was Daniel Woods&#8217; Creature from the Black Lagoon V16 in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, which he topped in September 2024. He sent Sleepwalker V15/16 at the end of 2020. He has lots of other hard boulders to his name, including The Wheel of Wolvo V14 at Lincoln Lake, Colorado, Brass Knuckles V14 in Dayton Pocket, Tennessee, and Esperanza V14 in Hueco Tanks, among others.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DUMf_aCgdpd/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> </p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Will Bosi on Return of the Sleepwalker V17</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/news/over-100-sessions-later-nathan-williams-tops-his-first-v17/\">Over 100 Sessions Later, Nathan Williams Tops His First V17</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

    "content_text": "<p>The re-birth of the Sicilian sport climbing destination</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/profiles/climbing-in-paradise-san-vito-lo-capo/\">Climbing in Paradise: San Vito Lo Capo</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p> <p>The re-birth of the Sicilian sport climbing destination</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/profiles/climbing-in-paradise-san-vito-lo-capo/\">Climbing in Paradise: San Vito Lo Capo</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published in the August/September 2025 print issue of Gripped Magazine under the authorship Jessica Kuepfer and Aaron Pardy.</em></p>\n<p>San Vito Lo Capo is a town located on the northwestern tip of Sicily. Known internationally by sun seekers for its white sand beach under the dramatic Monte Monaco, rock climbers have been flocking to the area for decades for the gorgeous seaside limestone. Although the area is informally referred to as San Vito, the climbing is found across a few locations, including San Vito Lo Capo, Macari, Castelluzzo, and Custonaci —all within a short drive from each other.</p>\n<p>Development of the area really started to pick up in the mid-2000s, with bolters Daniele Arena, Josef Gstöttenmayr, and Jim and Scott Titt leading the way. There are now around 1,300 sport routes in San Vito, ranging from 5.4 to 5.14d. Over 40% of these climbs are rated 5.10b and under, perfect for those climbing in the lower grades. San Vito also houses nearly two dozen multi-pitch climbs up the mighty Monte Monaco, most fully bolted, with a few trad adventures here and there.</p>\n<p>At first glance, San Vito Lo Capo is a climbing paradise, but its breathtaking Mediterranean views have come at a cost. The area has suffered from bolt corrosion due to its marine environment, a problem that has plagued many climbing areas around the world, most notably Railay/Tonsai in Thailand. Reports of bad bolts and anchors began to surface about San Vito in the 2010s, and the area went from being a sport climbing hotspot with huge potential to relative obscurity, at least outside of Europe.</p>\n<p>Although there are still plenty of climbers visiting during climbing season, San Vito has undoubtedly suffered from its ‘bad bolts’ reputation. The popularity of climbing has grown rapidly over the past ten years, and we can’t help but wonder how prominent of a climbing area San Vito would currently be if it didn’t suffer hardware issues.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66508\" style=\"width: 2560px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8681-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66508 size-full\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8681-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66508\">Monte Monaco overlooking the town of San Vito Lo Capo</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Recognizing the corrosion problem, a slow but steady re-bolting effort began in the late 2010s. Anchors were updated, bolts chopped and replaced, and entire crags were equipped with new gear—some with titanium, the best possible material to use close to the sea. Arena led much of this re-bolting effort, while other developers instead chose to bolt entire new crags with higher quality materials than in the past.</p>\n<p>Covid slowed these re-bolting efforts and hardware continued to corrode in the elements. In 2025, a new titanium re-bolting <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/rebolt-san-vito-lo-capo-2025-richiodatura-san-vito-lo-capo?utm_source=ig&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=link_in_bio&amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGn3jhnjEIumDLmLjsHkWo_43myu3RQ9ZocTydsupT3H5NEDK9JjLavoxrrwb8_aem_IakbiP2_QfRDyXpfv4688A\">fundraising initiative</a> was launched by local climber and hostel owner, Marco Peralta, along with Arena. Already very successful, the grassroots campaign has raised more than $20,000 CAD from hundreds of individual donations. You can donate to the bolt fund <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/rebolt-san-vito-lo-capo-2025-richiodatura-san-vito-lo-capo?utm_source=ig&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=link_in_bio&amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGn3jhnjEIumDLmLjsHkWo_43myu3RQ9ZocTydsupT3H5NEDK9JjLavoxrrwb8_aem_IakbiP2_QfRDyXpfv4688A\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This money has already gone towards re-bolting some of San Vito’s most iconic sectors, but there is a ton of more work to be done. In our opinion, hundreds of routes in the area are due for a re-bolt, a task that will take tens of thousands of dollars (or Euros) to complete.</p>\n<p>While bolt corrosion happened at a rapid pace in San Vito, every sport climbing area on the planet will eventually face what San Vito is trying to overcome. Bolts, regardless of material and location, do not last forever and will eventually need replacement. Sport climbing routes are a precious resource, and they need to be managed as such, requiring monitoring and funding to ensure they continue to exist in a safe state into the future. Without passionate individuals like Peralta and Arena, and continued donations to the re-bolting effort, San Vito climbing would surely rust away into oblivion, which would be a real shame for our sport.</p>\n<p>Now is a great time to visit San Vito. With more and more state-of-the-art hardware being installed, San Vito is getting a second life. The rock is incredible, the setting is stunning, the approaches are easy, the locals are friendly, the food is amazing, and the climbing crowds are minimal compared to other high-profile sport climbing destinations. If you operate at 5.10 and under, it’s hard to think of a better place for a climbing getaway.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66509\" style=\"width: 2054px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250224_104226_Original-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66509 size-full\" height=\"1157\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250224_104226_Original-1.jpg\" width=\"2054\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66509\">Super Santos 5.13a at White Wall</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>About the climbing</strong></h2>\n<p>The rock in San Vito is unique and diverse. Some crags were sculpted by the sea long ago, leaving eye-catching rounded features and a texture more similar to sandstone. Other crags involve steep cave climbing on bullet-hard tufas, stalactites, and wild tufa-blob concretions. The limestone ranges in colour from bright white to fiery red, with stripes of brown, grey, and black.</p>\n<p>No matter the grade, you can find awesome limestone features and interesting five-star lines. In San Vito, the “easy” climbing is as enjoyable as the “hard” climbing, with cool holds, funky features, and thoughtful moves. Bolt counts are generally friendly, and a large spread of grades at most crags means that partners and groups of mixed abilities can all find something to climb.</p>\n<p>The majority of climbing is found along the Scogliera di Salinella, a seaside cliff band over four kilometes in length. At the north end of this wall of rock, you’ll find Cala Mancina is one of the most scenic group of crags, with nearly all grades and styles being covered in a relatively short section of stone. The nearby Zoo crag might appear to be a humble wall. But the well-bolted easy climbs are incredibly fun, offering climbers in the 5.10-and-under range a chance to pull on neat features usually only found on harder routes.</p>\n<p>The middle section of the Scogliera di Salinella is dominated by Bunker, a huge white wall with an old World War II bunker sitting on top. The crag features a totally different experience on its unique white rock—undulating and technical, with the odd jam or two to leave you grinning ear to ear. Around the corner you’ll find Canalino, with some spectacular rock that you’d swear is sandstone, and Grotta della Palma, a cool cave and headwall with some incredibly good 5.12 climbs.</p>\n<p>At the southern end of the wall, you’ll find many crags, some easy, some hard. The popular Pipeline area offers a super short approach and a stunning, colourful wall of pockets, huecos, crimps, and slippery slopers.</p>\n<p>Other crags are dotted throughout the region. Crown of Aragon, our favourite crag in the area, offers seriously fun climbing on overhanging, bomber orange rock plastered with stalactite features. While the intimidating Never Sleeping Wall in Custonaci is home to jaw-dropping lines, the stone is often seeping, and many routes could use a re-bolt (more on bolts and conditions below). Nuova Ossessione offers similarly epic climbing, with huge 40-metre lines on slightly overhanging or vert terrain filled with tufas, stalactites, and pockets—but a significantly longer approach.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66510\" style=\"width: 911px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8502.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66510 size-full\" height=\"1215\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8502.jpg\" width=\"911\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66510\">The epic Never Sleeping Wall</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>When to visit</strong></h2>\n<p>The best time to climb in San Vito is from October to April, with ideal conditions in November. It’s a great winter destination, with most crags getting all-day or afternoon sun. Climbing is possible—even pleasant—through December, January, and February, although this time of year can be a little rainy. In the summer, San Vito Lo Capo becomes very busy with beach goers. While climbing is still possible for determined, early risers, it is tourist season and the hottest time of year.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to get there</strong></h2>\n<p>San Vito Lo Capo is located about 1 hour and 15 minutes from Palermo by car. You can find transfers from the airport to San Vito Lo Capo and back. Car rentals are affordable and conveniently located at or near the airport (usually with free shuttles). Having a car makes places like Crown of Aragon, Never Sleeping Wall, Nuova Ossessione, and others much more accessible. It should be noted, however, that a car is not absolutely necessary as there are plenty of walkable crags along the Scogliera di Salinella (depending on where you stay).</p>\n<h2><strong>Accommodation </strong></h2>\n<p>There are endless options for accommodations in San Vito Lo Capo. There are many B&amp;B’s and hotels, often fitted with kitchens or kitchenettes. There are also a few campgrounds. The El Bahira Camping Village is a popular spot for climbers at the southern end of the Scogliera di Salinella, offering tents, mobile homes, and villas right in front of hundreds of climbs, including the popular Pipeline sector. The Climbing House, run by Arena, is another great option just a few minutes’ walk from the Cala Mancina crags.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.siciliantimbuktu.com/en/\">Timbuktu Hostel</a> is wonderful place to stay in the heart of San Vito Lo Capo. Owned and operated by Peralta, it’s by far the coolest hostel we’ve visited. He also runs a small but well-stocked gear shop at the hostel called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sanvitolocapoclimbing/\">SV Climbing</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66511\" style=\"width: 1495px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8776.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66511 size-full\" height=\"1121\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8776.jpg\" width=\"1495\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66511\">The Cala Mancina Grotta, recently re-bolted with titanium</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>About the bolting</strong></h2>\n<p>Hundreds of routes in San Vito have bolts that are made of A2 (304) stainless steel, drilled into the rock in the period between the mid-2000s and mid-2010s. A2 bolts have a long history of failure in seaside settings, in San Vito and elsewhere. Although extreme corrosion and bolt failures have primarily occurred in steep cave formations in San Vito, on paper, there are an awful lot of bolts with the potential to fail.</p>\n<p>When we were climbing and scoping out the bolts in San Vito, we noticed that many A2 bolts appeared to be in excellent condition to the naked eye. But you never know what lies under the surface. We also saw many older A4 (316 and 316L) and even duplex bolts that were highly corroded, screaming for a titanium re-bolt.</p>\n<p>We personally chose not to climb on any routes equipped with A2 bolts while on our trip, and we still had more than enough routes to choose from, climbing on A4, duplex, and titanium. As part of the recent re-bolting campaign, Peralta and Arena are sharing awareness about the hardware issues through social media and signs at the crags. They are also closing routes with particularly sketchy bolts, flagging them with red ribbons.</p>\n<p>Climbers are strongly encouraged to report any problems they see and to donate to the bolt fund. Peralta and Arena have set a goal of reaching €50,000 (~$80,000 CAD), targeting the most potentially dangerous areas with old A2 hardware.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66512\" style=\"width: 1535px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8772.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66512 size-full\" height=\"2047\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8772.jpg\" width=\"1535\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66512\">New titanium bolts on The Riddle 5.11d at Cala Mancina</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>Conditions</strong></h2>\n<p>Other than hardware corrosion, the only other negative about San Vito is the conditions. They can be downright tricky to understand and manage, particularly for hard climbing where wind, humidity, sun, and shade can make or break a send.</p>\n<p>San Vito is windy, and when the winds are dry, the conditions are amazing. Unfortunately for climbers, these winds can often be humid, leaving the rock feeling soapy and slippery. Condensation is a significant problem in the area. Some crags are condensed for weeks at a time. When it gets really bad, you can even observe little salt crystals that have deposited on the rock from the humid breezes.</p>\n<p>Other walls seem mostly immune to the issue. Most cliffs are somewhere in between. Often a climb will feel great until you reach a humid pocket, crack, or flake. If you make it past the gooey hold, your hands will feel slimy for the next set of moves. Brushing is very helpful for improving friction.</p>\n<p>The sun is another thing to manage. If you don’t mind climbing in the sun, you have plenty of options as most crags face south, west, or southwest. Otherwise, early starts are the name of the game, so you can complete your climbing day before the sun hits the wall midday. While there are a few north-facing crags, they are a rarity, and it is not uncommon for the approach to be a spiky, bush-whacking adventure depending on the time of year.</p>\n<p>After heavy rainfall, many crags seep, as is typical of tufa- and stalactite-featured limestone. There is sometimes a delay in the seepage, meaning that a wall might be dry after a day of heavy rain, but damp a couple of days later. Vert and slab walls tend to dry quickly, but any wall with caves and tufa features are prone to seepage after heavy, prolonged rainfall.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66514\" style=\"width: 1381px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8310.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66514 size-full\" height=\"1842\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8310.jpg\" width=\"1381\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66514\">Mega Dave 5.13a at Crown of Aragon</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>Guidebook</strong></h2>\n<p>There are a few different guidebooks for the area, and each comes with its own pros and cons. The most recent is <em>Sicily Rock</em> by Ulrich and Harald Röker. It’s a great guide with easy-to-use picture topos and approach instructions. In the latest 2024 edition, they included bolt type information for most climbs, helping you pick areas and routes with good gear. The book doesn’t include the 2025 titanium re-bolt information for Cala Mancina, Cala Mancina Grotta, and Grotta dei Santi.</p>\n<p>Published in 2021 by Rockfax, <em>Sicily</em> by Daimon Beail is another great book. Like Sicily Rock, it has great picture topos and approach instructions. Unlike Sicily Rock, it doesn’t include bolt quality information, but it does include route descriptions and climbing areas in Palermo.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to climb all around the island of Sicily, Versante Sud’s <em>Di Roccia di Sole</em> by Massimo Cappuccio and Giuseppe Gallo is the book to get. Published in 2022, it includes San Vito, Palermo, and many other climbing areas throughout the island. You can buy the guidebooks online or at SV Climbing in San Vito Lo Capo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Food</strong></h2>\n<p>Sicily has a reputation as a gastronomic capital. There are many restaurants in San Vito Lo Capo, but if you visit during the winter, all but a few will be closed for the season. Bakeries are abundant and offer restaurant-quality food on a budget. There are several grocery stores, greengrocers, and supermarket chains like Conad and Supermercati Deco in town. The cheese and meat counters are a vision for anyone who loves a good charcuterie board, and the fresh pasta offerings are fun to explore if you enjoy cooking.</p>\n<p>Some local delights you shouldn’t miss include arancine (deep fried rice balls stuffed with bolognese, cheese and spinach, or cheese and prosciutto), sfincione (a pizza-like offering with a spongy dough topped with tomatoes, onions, cheese, anchovies, bread crumbs and/or olive oil), pane e panelle (a sandwich filled with chickpea fritter), couscous (there is even an annual couscous Festival in San Vito Lo Capo) and Caldo Freddo (sponge cake soaked in rum, topped with hot chocolate, ice cream, and whipped cream).</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66506\" style=\"width: 2560px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250311_160049_Original-1-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66506 size-full\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250311_160049_Original-1-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66506\">A perfect swimming and snorkeling spot near the climbing.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>Rest days</strong></h2>\n<p>It takes roughly four hours to drive the island from east to west. And while it isn’t a massive distance to cover, you could spend a lifetime exploring all that Sicily has to offer. There is something for everyone: archaeological sites, cathedrals, palaces, beaches, scenic hikes, and concerts for lovers of every musical genre.</p>\n<p>If you want to combine your history fix with a day at the spa, the ancient Greek temple and theatre of Segesta and the Segesta Hot Springs are only a one hour’s drive away. If you would like a change of scenery, the charming medieval town of Erice is less than an hour away, perched atop a mountain with breathtaking views.</p>\n<p>The capital of the province, Trapani, is a 50-minute drive from town. Here you can go shopping, stroll along the harbour front, visit the salt flats, and stay for dinner and a show at one of its many theatres, or find live music at a bar.</p>\n<p>Next to San Vito Lo Capo, you’ll find the Riserva Della Zingaro, offering endless scenic trails overlooking the sea. You also can’t miss the beautiful beaches in San Vito Lo Capo and Macari, as well as the gorgeous swimming area near the Cala Mancina crags. If you’re a mountain biker, you can rent bikes through Arena at The Climbing House.</p>\n<p>You will most likely fly into Palermo, and should plan to spend at least a day or two in the city, rich in history, culture, art, music, and food.</p>\n<h2><strong>Other climbing in the region</strong></h2>\n<p>Bosco Scorace is less than an hour away features some fantastic bouldering, with over 400 lines on primo sandstone. If you didn’t bring your pads, you can rent them from the nearby B&amp;B Polvere di Stelle. The bouldering gym Dolmen Climb is one hour away in Trapani, and is well worth the visit for some training or climbing on a rainy day. Palermo also has a lifetime of sport climbing in and around the Mondello neighborhood.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_66513\" style=\"width: 1287px;\"><a href=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8518.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66513 size-full\" height=\"965\" src=\"https://gripped.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8518.jpg\" width=\"1287\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-66513\">Never Sleeping Wall from afar</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://gripped.com/profiles/climbing-in-paradise-san-vito-lo-capo/\">Climbing in Paradise: San Vito Lo Capo</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://gripped.com\">Gripped Magazine</a>.</p>"

The price of outdoor gear has been <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/gear-news/trade-war-outdoor-gear/\">steadily creeping up</a>, and your wallet has likely felt the impact. To help <em>Outside</em> readers get out there without blowing their budgets, we&#8217;re introducing the <em>Outside</em> Deals Finder.</p>\n<p><a class=\"o-button\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/deals\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check Out the Deals Finder Here!</a></p>\n<h2>What Is the <em>Outside</em> Deals Finder?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/deals\"><em>Outside</em> Deals Finder</a> is our hack for monitoring the best deals on outdoor gear across the Internet, all at once. We&#8217;ve figured out a way to aggregate deals on outdoor gear from retailers we love (like <strong>REI, Backcountry, evo,</strong> and <strong>Competitive Cyclist</strong>) into one searchable hub. That way, instead of spending hours scouring the web for sales, deals, and discounts, you can go straight to the Deals Finder and know that you&#8217;ve got the lowest prices, right at your fingertips.</p>\n<h2>How to Use the <em>Outside</em> Deals Finder</h2>\n<p>Head to the <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/deals\"><strong>Deals Finder</strong></a> by clicking the &#8220;Deals&#8221; tab in the navigation menu. That&#8217;s it! From there, you can choose your own deal-finding adventure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Window Shopping: </strong>Not sure what you&#8217;re looking for yet? We recommend sorting by <strong>&#8220;Biggest Discount&#8221;</strong> to bring the most eye-popping deals to the top of your search. Here, you&#8217;ll likely find heavily discounted ski jackets, bibs, tents, and sleeping pads—traditionally expensive items that have been majorly marked down.</li>\n<li><strong>Specific Searching: </strong>If you have a particular item, brand, or category in mind, you can search for it specifically. Try &#8220;Nemo sleeping pad,&#8221; &#8220;Garmin,&#8221; or &#8220;ski jackets,&#8221; for example, and see what the Deals Finder turns up.</li>\n<li><strong>Sorting by Price: </strong>Like on other retail sites, you can change your search to sort by &#8220;Price: High to Low&#8221; or &#8220;Price: Low to High.&#8221; That way, you can easily find gear that fits your budget. Heads up: our data feed refreshes every few hours, so if you see a slight discrepancy between the Deals Finder and the retailer, that&#8217;s why.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Use the Deals Finder?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, really—use the Deals Finder to save money and time, then put those extra hours and dollars toward your next outdoor adventure. Here&#8217;s why we know you&#8217;ll love it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find the gear you know you&#8217;ll always need. </strong>Think consumables you&#8217;ll need to replace at some point—mountain bike tires, running shoes, fuel canisters, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Shop outdoor gear for kids. </strong>We know that buying outdoor gear for children can be a frustrating, expensive task—you&#8217;re lucky if their gear lasts a full season, whether your kid hits a surprise growth spurt or is just rough on their stuff. We see the Deals Finder as a key tool for parents who want their families to get outside, without spending hundreds of dollars on items with a short shelf life. Search &#8220;kids&#8221; or &#8220;child&#8221; and see where that takes you.</li>\n<li><strong>Spot the big-ticket discounts—before they sell out. </strong>When there&#8217;s a deal on an expensive item (like a mountain bike), it&#8217;s likely to sell out <em>fast</em>. The Deals Finder is your shortcut to snagging the deal you want on a wish-list item before it&#8217;s gone for the season.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughtful curation from retailers we trust. </strong>We piloted this project with retailers we know <em>Outside </em>readers (and employees!) love and shop at frequently. We&#8217;ve done that for two reasons: First, to filter out the noise from every online sale ever and bring you the deals you actually want. Second, we vouch for these retailers—we know they have strong customer service, reasonable return policies, and knowledgeable experts on staff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ready to browse? Head to the <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/deals\">Deals Finder</a>, start your shopping carts, and get out there.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/introducing-outside-deals-finder/\">Introducing the Outside Deals Finder, Your Go-To Tool for the Best Deals on Outdoor Gear</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com\">Outside Online</a>.</p>"

An Expert Weighs In.\" src=\"https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Vonn4.jpg?width=1200\" /></figure><p>As if the <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/snow-sports/lindsey-vonn-olympic-comeback/\">Lindsey Vonn comeback</a> couldn&#8217;t get any more dramatic.</p>\n<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been hibernating in a cave, you may have read that Vonn, the comeback queen of American ski racing, is enduring a rollercoaster ride in the final days before the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.</p>\n<p>After dominating the Downhill World Cup in November and December, Vonn, 41, crashed hard on January 30 during a warmup run ahead of the Crans-Montana World Cup. As far as ski racing crashes look, this one appeared bad—Vonn had to be airlifted from the slope.</p>\n<p>A few days later, she announced the extent of the damage: a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), bone bruising, and damage to her meniscus. Despite these wounds, Vonn told reporters that she is powering ahead toward the women&#8217;s Olympic Downhill, which will be held on Sunday, February 8.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every day my knee’s gotten better,&#8221; Vonn <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/47826052/coach-lindsey-vonn-no-workout-pain-confident-race'\">told The Associated Press on February 3</a>. &#8220;And every day we’re discussing with a full medical team, doctors, physios, everyone, to make sure we’re doing everything to make sure I am making smart and safe decisions.&#8221;</p>\n<code class=\"js-social-shortcode instagram\" style=\"display: none;\"></code>\n<h2>What a Doctor Says About Lindsey Vonn&#8217;s Torn ACL</h2>\n<p>Since then, the Internet has been abuzz with <a href=\"https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/colorado-news/doctors-react-to-lindsey-vonns-torn-acl/73-3409d534-d504-4031-8980-883e08881e61\">experts weighing in</a> on <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/04/lindsey-vonn-injury-canceled-training-run-olympics/88508753007/\">Vonn&#8217;s decision to race</a>, despite her injured knee. The ACL connects your thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia), and provides stability to your leg when your knee is bent. Sounds pretty important, right?</p>\n<p>Well, it turns out that other elite skiers have competed despite having torn the tendon. Three weeks after tearing her ACL, Italian downhiller <a href=\"https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/sofia-goggia-three-weeks-after-partial-acl-tear-wins-downhill-silver\">Sofia Goggia won a World Cup race in 2022</a>. Vonn even raced in the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/04/lindsey-vonn-ski-torn-acl-winter-olympics/88506213007/\">2014 Olympics in Sochi with an ACL tear</a>.</p>\n<p>I recently spoke to Dr. Kevin Stone, an orthopedic surgeon in California and ACL expert, who was also the U.S. Ski Team&#8217;s doctor from 1988 until 2002. Dr. Stone told me an ACL tear during skiing is usually traumatic and leaves an athlete hobbled and with agonizing pain.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What typically happens when you rupture the ACL skiing is you jam the tibia forward into the femur, the tibia bruises the bone and tears the stabilizing meniscus cartilage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That combo leads to swelling and pain and instability right away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yeah—not exactly the condition you&#8217;d want to be in when hurdling down an icy ski slope at 70 miles per hour.</p>\n<p>When I brought up the fact that other ski racers have competed with a torn ACL, Dr. Stone laughed and reminded me that &#8220;not every ACL tear is the same.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you hear about athletes who skied well on their ACL, it&#8217;s often because they tore it a while ago and then learned to accommodate skiing without it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But yes, there are pro athletes who are able to accommodate a somewhat unstable knee and still perform.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dr. Stone characterized these patients as having a &#8220;chronic&#8221; ACL tear—it&#8217;s a long-lasting injury that is sometimes not fixed. Vonn&#8217;s tear is acute—she is only a few days removed from the crash.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m simplifying Dr. Stone&#8217;s analysis of Vonn&#8217;s injury here: <em>the timing of it totally sucks</em>. Had she ruptured the ACL several weeks ago, her body and brain would have time to heal and adjust to the injury. But Vonn only has a few days until go-time.</p>\n<p>Still, Vonn has sounded confident in her decision to go forward. So has her coach, Chris Knight.</p>\n<p>“I’m pretty confident that she can still pull off this dream,” Knight <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-lindsey-vonn-injury-coach-2b3ca582a428d521d125dfbfe7c82961\">told The Associated Press on February 4</a>. “I’ve got no doubts in my mind that this is going to be OK.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Stone told me that Vonn, Knight, and the rest of the world will find out whether or not she can compete in Cortina at the exact same time. Her first training descent on the Cortina Downhill course will be the make-or-break point, Dr. Stone said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If she can do a training run, then the likelihood that her injuries are too severe to compete is low,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Vonn was slated to complete a practice run on the Cortina course on Thursday, February 5. But bad weather and heavy snow have now pushed the practice run back to Friday, February 6.</p>\n<p>Thus, American ski racing fans—and more than a few orthopedic surgeons—will be watching Vonn&#8217;s run while crossing their fingers, knocking on wood, and rubbing lucky rabbits&#8217; feet during the descent. Dr. Stone told me he will be one of them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We may get our answer the first time she tries to arc a turn, and definitely the first time she goes off a jump,&#8221; Dr. Stone said. &#8220;We&#8217;re all going to be holding our breath.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I know I will be.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/snow-sports/lindsey-vonn-torn-acl/\">Can Lindsey Vonn Race the Olympics with a Torn ACL?

Here's How.\" src=\"https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled-Design.jpg?width=1200\" /></figure><p>Imagine living in the heart of Yosemite Valley or on the rim of the Grand Canyon without paying a dime for rent. If that sounds like a dream come true—well, it can be a reality. The National Park Service (NPS) is now hiring summer campground hosts for national park sites across the United States.</p>\n<p>A recent roundup by <a href=\"https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2026/02/national-park-service-seeks-campground-host-volunteers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>National Parks Traveler</em></a> highlighted campground host positions open for the summer of 2026 at a number of popular national parks. But there are far more positions than that available. <em>Outside’s</em> recent search of available NPS camp host jobs revealed nearly 60 different roles at locations ranging from <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/tag/yosemite-national-park/\">Yosemite</a> to Devil’s Tower, Bryce Canyon, North Cascades, and Lake Mead.</p>\n<h2>How Do I Apply?</h2>\n<p>For starters, you need to create a profile on <a href=\"http://Volunteer.gov\">Volunteer.gov</a>, the federal government’s portal for recruiting and managing volunteers. Unlike some federal jobs, if you want to be a camp host, you don’t apply to a general pool. Instead, you apply to specific listings at individual parks.</p>\n<p>You can use the filters on the left side of the search tool to search for positions by agency. The filter tool also allows you to search by city or state, and eliminate jobs that don’t offer lodging space.</p>\n<p>Prior camp hosting, customer service, or maintenance experience is a plus. Participants will also usually need a valid U.S. driver&#8217;s license and their own RV or trailer to live in. The listing typically specifies the max size and hookup situation. For example, some sites offer water and sewage, but no electricity.</p>\n<p>Some hosting jobs allow for tent camping; others offer furnished cabins. One role at <a href=\"http://volunteer.gov/s/volunteer-opportunity/a09SJ00000KEDQ5YAP/dinosaur-national-monument-campground-hosts-co\">Dinosaur National Monument</a> in Colorado, for example, comes with an electric golf cart and a furnished one-bedroom apartment.</p>\n<p>Competition is fierce for campground hosting jobs at ultra-popular parks like <a href=\"https://www.volunteer.gov/s/volunteer-opportunity/a09SJ00000K0FunYAF/2026-yosemite-national-park-campground-host\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yosemite</a>. If you don’t have much prior experience, it’s smart to apply at a location that’s lesser-known, like this summer hosting job at <a href=\"https://www.volunteer.gov/s/volunteer-opportunity/a09SJ00000HhWMDYA3/2026-ozark-campground-host-summer\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Buffalo National River</a> in Arkansas.</p>\n<h2>What Does Being a Campground Host Entail?</h2>\n<p>The vast majority of campground host jobs are unpaid. Compensation is a free campsite or RV hookup. In exchange, every host job has different requirements depending on its location.</p>\n<p>Most camp host jobs involve working outside for most of the day. Hosts are responsible for keeping the campground and fire pits clean, performing basic maintenance, restocking the toilets, and assisting visiting campers with check-in. Hosts also serve as the eyes and ears of park rangers, patrolling the grounds and ensuring campers follow the rules. You aren’t expected to enforce these rules, but you are expected to report to the park’s law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Some camp host jobs also have very specific (but usually mellow) requirements. This camp host position at Mammoth Cave requires the ability to lift at least 25 pounds. The role at Arizona&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.volunteer.gov/s/volunteer-opportunity/a09SJ00000KFyunYAD/bonita-canyon-camp-host\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chiricahua National Monument</a> states that hosts must be able to walk at least one mile per day.</p>\n<p>Many national parks have dedicated pages on their websites that explain the role, such as this page for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grba/getinvolved/supportyourpark/campground-hosting.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Great Basin National Park</a> in Nevada. You can also find all available camp host jobs and detailed information on <a href=\"http://Volunteer.gov\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Volunteer.gov</a>.</p>\n<h2>When Should I Submit My Application?</h2>\n<p>The NPS processes applications on a rolling basis, and the most sought-after destinations, like Yosemite, fill up quickly. So if you want to trade your office chair for a campfire this summer, dust off your resume and hit submit sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/environment/national-park-campground-host/\">Want to Live in a National Park Rent-Free?

Here’s what they said.</p>\n<h2><b>Is Hot Water Really Better for Your Health and Well-Being?</b></h2>\n<p>In Chinese herbal medicine, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.weinayu/video/7395356888701046062?q=chinese%20hot%20water%20health&#038;t=1770065113372\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hot or warm water is preferred</a> over cooler temperatures because it helps to support <a href=\"https://www.scuhs.edu/acm-article/why-chinese-herbal-medicine-students-and-practitioners-avoid-ice/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">spleen</a> function and reduces bloating in the stomach and puffiness in the face.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that water—regardless of its temperature—is hydrating, says <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/DardarianNyree/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nyree Dardarian</a>, a sports nutritionist and the director of human nutrition at Drexel University. In general, men should aim to drink 15.5 cups of fluids daily, and women should shoot for 11.5 cups, according to the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20National%20Academies%20of,fluids%20a%20day%20for%20women\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mayo Clinic</a>. You will get just as hydrated with a hot cup as you will with a cold cup, says Dardarian.</p>\n<p>Now, there are some myths circulating around the benefits of hot water. Namely, that it can melt fat. “That is not true,” says Dardarian. It also <a href=\"https://www.uvahealth.com/healthy-balance/warm-water-healthier-myths-facts/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">won’t detox</a> your body.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/are-there-health-benefits-to-drinking-hot-water\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> on hot water is limited. According to Dardarian, some evidence suggests hot water, especially when consumed on an empty stomach, can help stimulate <a href=\"https://health.ucsd.edu/care/gastroenterology/gastrointestinal-motility/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gastric motility</a>, which refers to how well food moves through and exits your GI tract. That’s why some people say it helps them have more regular bowel movements, Dardarian says. Warm liquids can also relax your stomach muscles, she adds, which may help relieve bloating, distention, and constipation.</p>\n<p>Having warm water shortly before a meal can slow gastric emptying, or the process in which food is digested and moves from your stomach to your small intestine, she adds. Warm water increases gastric volume (the amount of contents in the stomach) and activates stretch receptors in your stomach, which send signals of fullness, Dardarian adds. This, in turn, slows the rate at which food moves from your stomach into your small intestine.</p>\n<p>“This means food will take longer to digest, and that can be helpful with things like maintaining blood glucose,” she says. Everyone’s blood sugar levels sporadically spike, and that’s normal, but keeping it steady helps prevent energy crashes, hunger pangs, and mood swings, Dardarian says.</p>\n<h2>Could Hot Water Boost Your Exercise Performance?</h2>\n<p>Sadly, the odds of hot water turning you into a pro athlete are slim. Why? Cold water lowers your core body temperature, according to Dardarian. “Lowering core body temperature helps to maintain a higher level of performance and for a longer duration,” she says. So hot water, while still hydrating, likely isn’t going to help you set a new PR.</p>\n<p>“Hot water during workouts usually isn’t ideal,” says Dardarian. This is especially true in warmer environments, says Dardarian, because chilled or room-temperature water helps regulate body temperature.</p>\n<p>When it comes to your workouts, being parched can impact your <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8336541/\">strength and power</a>, <a href=\"https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2023/01/tough-workouts-you-could-be-dehydrated\">motor control, and concentration</a>. Drinking cool water can encourage you to <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/easy-ways-to-drink-more-water/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stay adequately hydrated</a>. Think about the last time you pushed yourself to the limit at the gym. Did you want to chug hot tea after a rep? Probably not. According to Dardarian, most people are able to drink a larger volume of water when it’s at room temperature or chilled compared to a hot cup.</p>\n<p>There is one one caveat. If drinking warm water—with, say, lemon, orange, or a piece of your favorite fruit—increases the amount of fluids you consume during your physical activity, then, hey, stay with it. “There are many studies that show a majority of people live in mild to moderate chronic dehydration that leads to fatigue, headache, and sluggishness,&#8221; says Dardarian.</p>\n<p>This is to say: If hot water is the key to quenching your thirst, “then do it,” says Dardarian.</p>\n<p>Other than that, hot water can be a relaxing treat at other points in the day. After all, it can be soothing, says Dardarian. “It can be part of a calming ritual in the morning or before bedtime,” she says.</p>\n<p><strong>Want more <em>Outside</em> health stories? <a class=\"text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" href=\"https://hub.outsideinc.com/bodywork_newsletter_sign_up-0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for the Bodywork newsletter</a>.

That honor goes to Eddie Bauer, who patented the first goose down jacket after almost dying of hypothermia on a winter fishing trip in 1935. He wanted something as warm as a heavy wool coat, but lighter and more breathable. So he stuffed goose feathers into a quilted jacket and called it the Skyliner. The rest is history. Eddie Bauer may have invented the puffy, but The North Face made it cool with the Nuptse. This oversized, bulky puffy has been a fashion staple for the last 30 years, worn by rappers and suburban kids alike. It has become an icon of streetwear, though The North Face designed it specifically for the mountains.</p>\n<h2>The 1992 Nuptse: A Technical Jacket Built for the Mountains</h2>\n<p>Originally released in 1992, and named after a daunting peak in the Himalayas, the Nuptse was built as a <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/snow-sports-gear/budget-ski-jackets/\">technical jacket</a> designed with input from TNF’s global expedition team. Just like Eddie Bauer, those mountaineers in the &#8217;90s wanted a jacket with excellent warmth-to-weight ratio that could also handle the rigors of climbing.</p>\n<p>“We had been making down jackets since the early &#8217;70s, but the Nuptse was a revolutionary step towards lightweight warmth for the most extreme outdoor conditions,” says TNF’s chief design officer Ebru Ercon, citing a unique baffle design that allowed for more loft and prevented the down insulation from migrating out of place and inadvertently creating cold spots. The torso was cut short so climbers could easily access their harness below the jacket. An overlay on the shoulder of the jacket added durability where a pack would sit—another functional design choice that gave the Nuptse its now iconic black color blocking on the shoulders.</p>\n<h2>From Everest to the Streets: How the Nuptse Became a Style Icon</h2>\n<p>All of these thoughtful, tactical details that made the Nuptse an ideal expedition layer helped it stand out against other puffies of the ’90s. It just looked…badass. Influential personalities of the &#8217;90s hip hop scene (we just called it “rap” back then) adopted the oversized puffy, wearing it in music videos, photo shoots, and through the streets of New York City. Why? Partly because the Nuptse was warm, but mostly because the jacket looked great with jeans and a pair of Timberland boots.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DSRIYGpjezt/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> </p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>I spent most of my high school career lusting over this oversized pillow of a jacket precisely because some of my favorite hip hop artists wore it. I lived in Georgia, where it rarely gets below 30 degrees, and the toughest adventure I had in mind was cutting across my neighbor’s farm to get to my best friend’s house. But still, the Notorious B.I.G. wore one. So did Redman. I had to have a Nuptse.</p>\n<p>“What differentiated the Nuptse from many other mainstream puffies on the market back then is that it was designed to be an on-mountain, expedition-proven product, ready to withstand the harshest climates on the planet,” Ercon says. And yet…“The Nuptse became a signature piece for some of the world’s biggest artists in the ‘90s.”</p>\n<h2>The Drake Effect—and the Nuptse’s Lasting Appeal</h2>\n<p>Rappers and suburban white kids wearing hardcore technical jackets designed for Everest to the mall might be the literal definition of irony. And the Nuptse was just getting started. In 2011, Drake wore a leopard print version of the Nuptse—a collab design with <a href=\"https://supreme.com/news/685/images?=1\">Supreme</a>—in his video, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDKK95cpfM\">The Motto</a>,” and the jacket’s popularity with gen-pop hit a fever pitch.</p>\n<p>“In the early 2000s, we were still selling the Nuptse primarily in the outdoor specialty space, but after the Drake video, the jacket continued to garner momentum with a growing fan base,” Ercon says. “That’s when it became a true streetwear/lifestyle staple product.”</p>\n<p>And the Nuptse’s popularity continues. The jacket hasn’t changed much since its original debut back in ’92. The latest version, the ’96 Retro, looks almost identical to the jacket I wanted so badly when I was a teenager in the mid-90s, but it features higher-performing shell fabrics, more recycled materials, and better DWR treatments. But it still looks good with some jeans and Timberland boots—and yes, suburban kids still want to wear it to the mall. I recently got a Nuptse vest to test for this article— two-toned blue with the black color blocking on the shoulders, just like the one I wanted when I was a teenager. Now I just have to wait for my 16-year-old daughter, who has been wearing it nonstop, to give it back.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_2731026\"><img alt=\"Skier wearing The North Face Nuptse vest \" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2731026\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TNF-Nuptse-Jacket_Averill.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2400\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">The author&#8217;s daughter wears The North Face Nuptse vest she commandeered from her dad. </span> (Photo: Graham Averill)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Why The North Face’s Technical Gear Keeps Crossing Over</h2>\n<p>The Nuptse isn’t TNF’s only technical jacket to successfully cross-over into the mainstream. The brand’s Denali fleece has been a staple at frat parties since I was matriculating, and the Mountain Jacket, a <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/snow-sports-gear/budget-ski-jackets/\">waterproof, technical winter shell</a>, also enjoyed its adoption in streetwear culture in the &#8217;90s. The Notorious B.I.G. even called out The North Face in one of his songs. I can’t repeat the lyrics here, but you can google it.</p>\n<p>The demands of expeditions still drive The North Face&#8217;s development today, but the brand continues to court streetwear enthusiasts through regular collaborations with brands like Supreme and the creation of layers that just look great, whether you’re a mountaineer at Everest basecamp or a teenager hanging out in the parking lot of Taco Bell.</p>\n<p>Here are four TNF puffies that have crossover appeal, including my favorite puffy of all time.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/clothing-apparel/north-face-nuptse-puffer-jacket/\">How The North Face’s Nuptse Jacket Went From Everest to the Streets</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com\">Outside Online</a>.</p>"

Chisos Mountains Lodge remains fully closed, while water spigots, sinks, and toilets at parts of the park have also been shut off.</p>\n<p>The closures come after a water pump failed in December at Oak Spring, which provides the sole water source to the Chisos Basin area, staff wrote on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BigBendNPS/posts/pfbid02R19mWJzJdDw14vVZ3HUNsEfeWCczCWLeDwYeXF41JTj6WoLQjRCqKNqWcRJ3LSYgl\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.

Chisos Basin is one of the jewels of Big Bend National Park, and while this issue is localized, it underscores the importance of investing in our national parks and addressing deferred infrastructure maintenance,” Matt Rice, Southwest regional director for the conservation nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.americanrivers.org/?gad_source=1&#038;gad_campaignid=1669580288&#038;gbraid=0AAAAAD-YJLQexADerwuq6ilpGadT0-aqP&#038;gclid=CjwKCAiAs4HMBhBJEiwACrfNZTECSRIKG1yikmxW0iW8Yzq6H4dBPIc6p7ZZVnNDZpRwBLHDvJvLfhoCOQYQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">American Rivers</a>, told <em>Outside</em>.</p>\n<p>A water shortage is a troubling problem for such a biologically important park. Big Bend contains the United States’ most representative example of the diverse Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/learn/management/statistics.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NPS</a>. And the closure has experts like Rice concerned.</p>\n<p>“Low flows and aging infrastructure signal a long-term challenge for river health, Big Bend National Park, and communities on both sides of the border that depend on the Rio Grande for water, wildlife, and cultural identity,” he said.</p>\n<p>At more than 800,000 acres, <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/tag/big-bend-national-park/\">Big Bend National Park</a> is a vast desert region with scarce water resources. <a href=\"https://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/water/environconcerns/regions/bigbend.phtml#:~:text=The%20Big%20Bend%2C%20also%20known%20as%20the,Rio%20Grande**%20*%20**Major%20Aquifer:%20Hueco%2DMesilla%20Bolson**\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Texas Parks and Wildlife</a> reports that water shortages frequently occur in the area due to the combined effects of long-term drought and low annual rainfall, averaging less than 12 inches per year. These environmental constraints are compounded by human impact. Overuse of aquifers can lower the water table and dry up nearby springs, and irrigation for ranching accounts for a large share of the area&#8217;s water use.</p>\n<p>“The more significant and far-reaching water challenge in Big Bend is the persistent low flows in the Rio Grande,” said Rice. “Prolonged drought, aging water infrastructure, rising temperatures, and water diversions have reduced the river in some stretches to a shallow trickle, stressing native fish and riparian habitat, limiting recreation, and undermining the international river system that defines the U.S.–Mexico border.”</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just Big Bend that has seen a recent spate of water issues, either. In early 2026, multiple <a href=\"https://www.kjzz.org/fronteras-desk/2026-01-21/phantom-ranch-at-the-grand-canyon-closed-due-to-water-line-issues\">water line breaks</a> shut down parts of the Grand Canyon&#8217;s South Rim, including Phantom Ranch and Bright Angel Campground. Glacier National Park experienced a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/news/high-water-consumption-and-low-water-levels-at-logan-pass-create-water-shortages.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">significant water shortage</a> in late 2025, prompting officials to turn off area supplies at the peak of visitor season.</p>\n<p>For now, Big Bend staff have a simpler reminder for those hoping to visit the Texas park in the near future.</p>\n<p>“In order to be fully prepared, we recommend bringing plenty of water with you to the park,” wrote NPS. Drinking water is available from a spigot at the Big Bend visitor center, where guests can also buy bottled water.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/environment/big-bend-national-park-closed-water-shortage/\">What Happens When a National Park Runs Out of Water?

Attia&#8217;s name appeared in more than 1,700 documents in the release, including direct messages between the two.</p>\n<p>On February 2, Attia <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterAttiaMD/status/2018350892395774116\">published a statement on X</a> apologizing to his patients and his staff for his connection to Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 after he was indicted on federal charges of sex trafficking minors in Florida and New York.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You’ve put your trust, your credibility, and your hard work into what we have built together, and I take that responsibility seriously,&#8221; Attia wrote. &#8220;You deserve a complete and honest account of what did and did not happen. I apologize that I did not get this out sooner, but I want to be thorough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Attia then stated he was not involved in any criminal activity and that his correspondence with Epstein had nothing to do with sexual abuse or exploitation. &#8220;I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties,&#8221; Attia added. &#8220;That said, I apologize and regret putting myself in a position where emails, some of them embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible, are now public, and that is on me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Attia&#8217;s emails with Epstein are <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00833985.pdf\">available on the DOJ website</a>. <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01745253.pdf\">In one email</a>, dated June 24, 2015, Attia told Epstein that he &#8220;got a fresh shipment.&#8221; Epstein replied &#8220;me too&#8221; alongside a photo that the DOJ has redacted. After a brief back-and-forth, Attia wrote, &#8220;You the biggest problem with becoming friends with you? The life you lead is so outrageous, yet I can&#8217;t tell a soul.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In his statement, Attia stated that he had received a shipment of Metformin, a diabetes medication, and that his correspondence referred to the drug. &#8220;He replied with the words &#8216;me too&#8217; alongside a photograph of an adult woman,&#8221; Attia wrote. &#8220;I responded with crude, tasteless banter. Reading that exchange now is very embarrassing, and I will not defend it. I&#8217;m ashamed of myself for everything about this. At the time, I understood this exchange as juvenile, not a reference to anything dark or harmful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Attia said in his online statement that he first came into contact with Epstein in 2014, and met with him on &#8220;seven or eight occasions&#8221; at Epstein&#8217;s home to discuss research. He said he last met with Epstein in the spring of 2019.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was not his doctor, though several times I answered general medical questions and recommended other providers to him,&#8221; Attia said in his statement on X.</p>\n<p>Attia, 52, is the co-author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Outlive: The Science &amp; Art of Longevity, </em>and the operator of a concierge medical practice in Austin, Texas. He also hosts the popular health podcast <em>The Peter Attia Drive, </em>and is the owner of the longevity app Outlive and the publisher of a weekly newsletter. In 2024 Attia was the subject of an <em>Outside </em>magazine profile. We followed Attia&#8217;s training regimen for several months before interviewing him at his clinic in Texas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are lots of people in the last decade of their life who are wonderfully happy with their children and their grandchildren, all those things,” Attia told <em>Outside </em>in the story. “But I just don’t meet many people whose bodies aren’t aching and who aren’t thinking, <em>God, I wish I could do something about this.</em> And the truth of it is, most of those people didn’t do all they could to reduce the probability of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In his statement, Attia said he confronted Epstein in 2018 after reading <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html\">a <em>Miami Herald</em> expose</a> that provided multiple sources accusing Epstein of operating a sex trafficking ring in Florida and New York City with underage girls. &#8220;In hindsight, even attempting to facilitate accountability was a mistake and once again reflected just how naive I was at the time,&#8221; Attia wrote. &#8220;Once the full scope of his actions was clear, disengagement should have been the only appropriate response. My intent does not change that, and I regret not drawing that boundary immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/exploration-survival/attia-epstein-apology/\">Peter Attia Just Apologized for His ‘Tasteless’ Email Exchanges with Jeffrey Epstein</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com\">Outside Online</a>.</p>"

Meaning, it can be hard to stay on track. Maybe you committed to three gym days per week, but then you don’t follow through. Or you told yourself you&#8217;d run every Saturday morning, and then&#8230;don&#8217;t. We’ve all been there.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons we struggle to meet exercise goals, including dwindling motivation, life getting in the way, and an unrealistic objective from the start. How can we avoid these pitfalls? I interviewed sports psychologists for advice on how to crush your fitness goals once and for all. By the way, if you&#8217;ve already fallen off the wagon, you haven&#8217;t failed; these tips will still help you get back on track.</p>\n<h2>1. Lower the Bar</h2>\n<p>It can feel invigorating to set big goals, like working out six days a week or training for a <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/run/gear-advice-after-26-marathons/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">marathon</a>, but this shoot-for-the-moon approach frequently backfires. That’s because we get caught up in doing things perfectly, and when the bar is set super high, there’s no buffer to adjust when life gets in the way (as it inevitably will).</p>\n<p>The solution? Set smaller goals so there’s built-in space for when things don’t go according to plan, says <a href=\"https://www.drerinhaugen.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Erin Haugen</a>, a sports and performance psychologist based in North Dakota. For example, if you scale your goal back from hitting the gym six days a week to just three, you have more wiggle room to still meet that target when work runs late on Tuesday. By dialing back your ambitions, you increase your chances of success, which grows your confidence and builds positive momentum, says Haugen. And that’s the mojo you need to eventually reach those loftier goals.</p>\n<h2>2. Celebrate the Small Wins</h2>\n<p>When you’re not yet where you want to be with your fitness ambitions, it’s easy to fixate on the gaps. But a better strategy is to celebrate what you <i>are </i>doing. “That’s going to create more momentum,” Haugen says.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drpaulmccarthy.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Paul McCarthy</a>, a psychologist in Glasgow, Scotland, specializing in sports and performance, suggests tracking the little wins that are within your control, such as how much effort you put into a given workout, or how well you follow through with your exercise plan for the week. This approach, he explains, builds competence and teaches you that your behaviors drive long-term results.</p>\n<p>One way to visualize these successes is to put a coin in a jar whenever you complete a workout, McCarthy says. When you have X amount of coins, treat yourself to a reward, like a night at the movies or new gym gear, he suggests. For additional motivation, Haugen suggests sharing your workout wins with others so they can help hype up your progress.</p>\n<h2>3. Create a Plan B</h2>\n<p>No matter how well you plan your workout schedule, life is going to throw curveballs that thwart it. Maybe your boss schedules a late meeting. Or the babysitter bails last minute. You can’t control these roadblocks, but you can have a backup plan.</p>\n<p>This could look like taking a <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/how-long-should-walk-every-day/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">20-minute walk</a> at lunch in lieu of your morning gym session, or doing a quick bodyweight workout at home instead of spin class. Committing to these fallbacks (and drafting them up in advance) allows you to keep your habit of exercising even when the specific activity has to change, McCarthy explains.</p>\n<h2>4. Make Things Easy</h2>\n<p>This isn’t about being lazy. Instead, it’s about lowering the activation energy it takes to exercise so you’re more likely to follow through.</p>\n<p>“For a lot of people, there’s a lot of decision-making that goes on around their training about the what, where, when, and why,” McCarthy explains. Reduce that cognitive load by creating structure and strategy around your fitness goals, he says. For example, you might decide to ride your bike for 30 minutes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning. Having structure and strategy helps with consistency and habit formation, McCarthy says.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, find small ways to make exercise an easier endeavor. The classic example is laying out your workout clothes the night before so it’s simpler to make it to your morning gym session, says <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/anne-friedlander?tab=bio\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Friedlander</a>, an adjunct professor of human biology at Stanford University. You could also join a fitness studio that you already pass on your drive from work, she adds. Or, if you’re an at-home exerciser like Friedlander, place your yoga mat or free weights in a visible, easy-to-access spot so it takes minimal effort to start a workout.</p>\n<h2>5. Fine-Tune Your Mindset</h2>\n<p>When exercise feels like a slog, you’re less inclined to do it. Two ways to combat this are picking a form of movement you genuinely love and working out with friends, Friedlander says. A third hack is adjusting your mindset, she adds. Instead of saying “I<i> have</i> to exercise,” try “I get to take this break and move,” says Friedlander. This will help you develop a more positive attitude about working out.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, McCarthy suggests thinking about your fitness goals as part of your identity. For example, telling yourself phrases like: “I&#8217;m the kind of person who trains even when sessions are challenging,” or “I’m somebody who swims three times a week,” can reinforce the behaviors that bring you closer to your goals, he says.</p>\n<p><strong>Want more <em>Outside</em> health stories? <a class=\"text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" href=\"https://hub.outsideinc.com/bodywork_newsletter_sign_up-0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for the Bodywork newsletter</a>.

The best running socks quietly stay in the background while protecting from abrasion, wicking moisture, providing underfoot comfort, imparting warmth, and, if you’re shallow like me, adding flair to your outfit.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot to expect from a seemingly simple wardrobe staple. Fortunately, there are lots of brands up to meeting the challenge. For runners, the challenge is choosing among the scores of good socks.</p>\n<p>As with other types of running apparel, the best socks for running tend to be made by specialty brands rather than shoe companies. Most of the socks that I singled out as superior are a blend of synthetic and natural fibers, with merino wool being the most common of the latter. The quality of the merino socks I tested is much higher than was the case a decade ago. Now, even the staunchest merino mavens acknowledge that <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/clothing-apparel/wool-versus-synthetic-socks/\">the fiber is enhanced in socks</a> by adding nylon and other materials for better stretch and durability.</p>\n<p>The 11 running socks below represent the best of what I tested. They run the gamut, from barely-there thinness to plushly padded, and from no-show to knee-high, with something to suit every preference.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/run/best-running-socks-guide/\">Best Running Socks for Every Style and Preference</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com\">Outside Online</a>.</p>"

Sitting near the Tigris River in southern Iran, the port city was founded by Alexander the Great, and once linked Mesopotamia with India, Central Asia, and China.</p>\n<p>Alexandria on the Tigris dates back to the 4th century BCE. Ancient sources suggest that after his conquest of the Persian Empire, Alexander wanted to return to Babylon by water. When he realized there was no suitable harbor to support his journey, he ordered the construction of a new port city.</p>\n<p>Strategically built near the confluence of the Tigris and Karun rivers and less than two kilometers from the Persian Gulf at the time, it became the perfect maritime trading hub between the East and West.</p>\n<p>Later, the city became known as Charax Spasinou or Charax Maishan. While historians have long known that such a city existed, its location remained a mystery.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A map showing the location of Alexandria on the Tigris (Alexandria Charax)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112101\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Karte_Info.jpg\" width=\"1500\" /><figcaption>A map showing the location of Alexandria on the Tigris. Image: Stefan Hauser</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Long-delayed field work</h2>\n<p>The recent study builds on research that began almost 70 years ago. In the 1960s, British researcher John Hansman examined aerial photographs taken by the Royal Air Force and noticed what appeared to be the outlines of a massive settlement near Jebel Khayyaber. Hansman was convinced he was looking at the remains of a major ancient city, but ongoing conflict along the Iran–Iraq border made fieldwork impossible for decades.</p>\n<p>In 2014, archaeologists were able to return to the region, and some were guided to Jebel Khayyaber by local authorities. They were astonished by what they saw: clearly defined city walls, some rising up to eight meters high.</p>\n<p>Two years later, Stefan Hauser, an archaeologist at the University of Konstanz, joined the project. For years, the team’s work was limited to painstaking surveys on foot.</p>\n<p>“Over the years, we then walked the entire area, over 500 kilometers in total, and documented all the surface finds, especially shards and broken bricks, that give us clues to a former settlement,” Hauser explains. These fragments slowly began to reveal the scale and sophistication of the city.</p>\n<p>Eventually, researchers deployed drones and caesium magnetometers, enabling them to fully map the city. The results show a dense grid of streets, residences, temples, waterways, and what appears to be a palace. Slightly to the north, archaeologists also uncovered the remains of a huge irrigation network, suggesting a population far larger than previously imagined. Estimates now range from 400,000 to 600,000 inhabitants.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Aerial map of a district with residential buildings and temples created with the caesium magnetometer.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112103\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Area-A-Jorg-Fassbinder_Galerie.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Aerial map of a district with residential buildings and temples created with the caesium magnetometer. Photo: Stefan Hauser</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>A second Alexandria</h2>\n<p>The city mirrors the design of the second, better-known Alexandria in Egypt. For more than 500 years, it was a central hub for long-distance trade.</p>\n<p>“We now realize that we really have the equivalent of Alexandria on the Nile, the famous city in Egypt,” says Hauser. “The situation is actually the same: a city is founded where the open sea and the river systems...meet.”</p>\n<p>He believes that nearly all maritime trade from India once passed through this port.</p>\n<p>The city’s slow decline was tied to environmental change in the region. As the Tigris River gradually shifted westward due to sedimentation, Alexandria on the Tigris became isolated from both the river and the Persian Gulf. By the 3rd century CE, it was simply too far inland to function as a port, and its role as the region’s primary maritime hub passed to Basra.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_112099\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Farchaeologists-discover-lost-city-of-alexandria-on-the-tigris%2F&amp;linkname=Archaeologists%20Discover%20Lost%20City%20of%20Alexandria%20on%20the%20Tigris\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Farchaeologists-discover-lost-city-of-alexandria-on-the-tigris%2F&amp;linkname=Archaeologists%20Discover%20Lost%20City%20of%20Alexandria%20on%20the%20Tigris\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Farchaeologists-discover-lost-city-of-alexandria-on-the-tigris%2F&amp;linkname=Archaeologists%20Discover%20Lost%20City%20of%20Alexandria%20on%20the%20Tigris\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Farchaeologists-discover-lost-city-of-alexandria-on-the-tigris%2F&amp;linkname=Archaeologists%20Discover%20Lost%20City%20of%20Alexandria%20on%20the%20Tigris\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Farchaeologists-discover-lost-city-of-alexandria-on-the-tigris%2F&amp;linkname=Archaeologists%20Discover%20Lost%20City%20of%20Alexandria%20on%20the%20Tigris\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Farchaeologists-discover-lost-city-of-alexandria-on-the-tigris%2F&amp;linkname=Archaeologists%20Discover%20Lost%20City%20of%20Alexandria%20on%20the%20Tigris\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Farchaeologists-discover-lost-city-of-alexandria-on-the-tigris%2F&#038;title=Archaeologists%20Discover%20Lost%20City%20of%20Alexandria%20on%20the%20Tigris\"></a></p>"

In the Sahara, he wanted to overcome heat; in the mountains, altitude; and here in winter Siberia, his challenge was the cold.</p>\n<p>He had officially registered his route in Yakutsk and received a safety briefing from a local official. Before setting out, he camped two nights in his tent to make sure his gear was up to the challenge.</p>\n<p>On Instagram, he admitted that he had some \"minor\" issues with his health but that they should not impede him.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_112085\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fpolish-cyclist-found-dead-in-siberian-hotel%2F&amp;linkname=Polish%20Cyclist%20Found%20Dead%20in%20Siberian%20Hotel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fpolish-cyclist-found-dead-in-siberian-hotel%2F&amp;linkname=Polish%20Cyclist%20Found%20Dead%20in%20Siberian%20Hotel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fpolish-cyclist-found-dead-in-siberian-hotel%2F&amp;linkname=Polish%20Cyclist%20Found%20Dead%20in%20Siberian%20Hotel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fpolish-cyclist-found-dead-in-siberian-hotel%2F&amp;linkname=Polish%20Cyclist%20Found%20Dead%20in%20Siberian%20Hotel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fpolish-cyclist-found-dead-in-siberian-hotel%2F&amp;linkname=Polish%20Cyclist%20Found%20Dead%20in%20Siberian%20Hotel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fpolish-cyclist-found-dead-in-siberian-hotel%2F&amp;linkname=Polish%20Cyclist%20Found%20Dead%20in%20Siberian%20Hotel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fpolish-cyclist-found-dead-in-siberian-hotel%2F&#038;title=Polish%20Cyclist%20Found%20Dead%20in%20Siberian%20Hotel\"></a></p>"

However, the German climber continues to train for it and to count down the days until next winter (323 days from now, by his reckoning) when he will try again. In the meantime, he is tryingto learn from past winter trailblazers. Recently, he met up with Polish soloist Krzysztof Wielicki.</p>\n<p>Wielicki and Leszek Cichy made the first winter ascent of Mount Everest in February 1980. Wielicki also achieved winter firsts on Kangchenjunga (1986) and on Lhotse (1988).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Polish pioneers Wielicki and Cichy after climbing Everest in winter.

Photo: Himalman.com</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>The challenge of a lifetime</h2>\n<p>The climbing scene has changed drastically since the 1980s, both in terms of logistics and equipment, but also in the approach of those aiming to climb 8,000m peaks in the harshest season. While winter expeditions remain rare, the current trend is to prioritize summit options by using supplementary oxygen and Sherpa staff.</p>\n<p>In this sense, Kobusch is a rarity. He has devoted the last decade to this single project. Kobusch wants to climb Everest the hardest way: solo, in winter, without oxygen, and up one of the longest routes on the mountain. He has been on the mountain on three occasions, most recently in <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/jost-kobusch-ends-his-everest-winter-expedition/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024-25</a>, when he reached 7,500m.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Jost Kobusch in full winter, high-altitude attire, with the summit of Everest behind him.\" class=\"wp-image-101514 size-large\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jost-Everest-e1736259691534-700x452.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption>Jost Kobusch on the West Ridge of Everest. Photo: Jost Kobusch</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some winter veterans consider the media-oriented, relatively inexperienced Kobusch an intruder. Before and after his first two visits to Everest, Kobusch received criticism from <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/messner-still-not-impressed-by-jost-kobusch/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reinhold Messner</a>, who doubted Kobusch could achieve, or even survive, a winter Everest ascent.</p>\n<p>However, Kobusch has proven to be a stubborn professional who understands that each attempt is part of the learning process that he hopes will eventually take him to the top of the world in his ambitious style.</p>\n<h2>The pioneer's voice</h2>\n<p>Kobusch sought an interview with Wielicki for \"feedback, perspective, and critique.\" On social media, Kobusch says he was not looking for confirmation or validation, but guidance. He received a warm, friendly welcome from Wielicki in Poland.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Wieliki and Kobusch shake hands at an airport.\" class=\"wp-image-112086 size-large\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jost-Wie-03-700x399.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption>Wielicki hosted Kobusch in his home and waved him goodbye at the airport. Photo: Jost Kobusch/YouTube</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"This meeting is about translating timeless principles into modern alpinism, applying old wisdom to new realities, and understanding what truly matters when climbing in winter at extreme altitude,\" Kobusch wrote.</p>\n<p>\"Winter is for fighters,\" was Wielicki's first comment. \"I went in winter because I was hungry for emotion...and to test myself, to check how far I could go.\"</p>\n<p>Wielicki pointed to the weather as the decisive factor during a climb. He reiterated the importance of reliable forecasts.

But as the world's most powerful people stall, deny, or ignore the problem, many now believe it is time to look for geoengineering solutions.</p>\n<p>Geoegineering, or climate engineering, involves deliberately altering the Earth's climate to counteract anthropogenic climate change. This possibility flared up again recently when a group of scientists and investors launched the <a href=\"https://seabedcurtain.org/\">Seabed Curtain Project</a>.</p>\n<p>The project proposes constructing a massive barrier will keep warm currents away from the Thwaites Glacier, forestalling its collapse and preventing over half a meter of sea level rise. The Thwaites Glacier is nicknamed the Doomsday Glacier because of its importance: If it goes, the entire West Antarctic ice sheet may soon follow.</p>\n<p>The idea is to build a sub-sea curtain 80km long and 150m high, sitting on the seabed 650m beneath the surface. The buoyant curtain would be anchored to heavy structures on the seafloor. Rather than one solid piece, the curtains would be made of many thin, overlapping panels of flexible material.</p>\n<p>What material, exactly, is something the current proposal isn't far enough along to know definitively. Their goal is to fund and deliver the research required to deploy the curtain by the year 2040.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A diagram showing an underwater curtain \" class=\"size-full wp-image-112067\" height=\"1076\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-seabed-curtain-project-illustration-with-labels.avif\" width=\"1908\" /><figcaption>A project diagram shows how the curtain would prevent warm, deep water from accelerating ice melt. Photo: The University of the Arctic</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>A bandaid solution?</h2>\n<p>Ice loss, warmer temperatures, and higher sea levels in the polar regions can act as <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/antarctic-collapse-9000-years-ago-hints-at-white-continents-future/\">positive feedbacks loops</a>, quickly accelerating the changes -- not just in those regions but elsewhere. Novel interventions on the Thwaites won't solve this but could buy vital time.</p>\n<p>However, climate engineering still has many detractors. The potential project's initial cost is $40 to $80 billion, with $1-2 billion more per year for maintenance over the curtain's 25-year lifespan.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/science/articles/10.3389/fsci.2025.1527393/full\">recent paper</a>, 41 climate scientists came out against such engineering. Massive, disruptive projects in the vulnerable polar regions, they argued, could have unforeseen consequences.</p>\n<p>A seabed curtain, in particular, they wrote, is nearly impossible logistically. It requires building a delicate yet massive piece of infrastructure in \"some of the world’s roughest seas...in ice-covered locations that even modern ice-strengthened vessels cannot always reach.\"</p>\n<p>Even if it could be done, they continue, a huge underwater wall would have unanticipated effects on marine ecosystems and oceanic circulation.</p>\n<p>The Thwaites has lost over 1,000 billion tons of ice since 2000, and the rate of loss is accelerating. Whether or not a seabed curtain is part of the solution, it's clear that some answer has to be found.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_112064\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsaving-the-doomsday-glacier-is-it-time-to-build-a-giant-antarctic-wall%2F&amp;linkname=Saving%20the%20Doomsday%20Glacier%3A%20Is%20It%20Time%20To%20Build%20A%20Giant%20Antarctic%20Wall%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsaving-the-doomsday-glacier-is-it-time-to-build-a-giant-antarctic-wall%2F&amp;linkname=Saving%20the%20Doomsday%20Glacier%3A%20Is%20It%20Time%20To%20Build%20A%20Giant%20Antarctic%20Wall%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsaving-the-doomsday-glacier-is-it-time-to-build-a-giant-antarctic-wall%2F&amp;linkname=Saving%20the%20Doomsday%20Glacier%3A%20Is%20It%20Time%20To%20Build%20A%20Giant%20Antarctic%20Wall%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsaving-the-doomsday-glacier-is-it-time-to-build-a-giant-antarctic-wall%2F&amp;linkname=Saving%20the%20Doomsday%20Glacier%3A%20Is%20It%20Time%20To%20Build%20A%20Giant%20Antarctic%20Wall%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsaving-the-doomsday-glacier-is-it-time-to-build-a-giant-antarctic-wall%2F&amp;linkname=Saving%20the%20Doomsday%20Glacier%3A%20Is%20It%20Time%20To%20Build%20A%20Giant%20Antarctic%20Wall%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsaving-the-doomsday-glacier-is-it-time-to-build-a-giant-antarctic-wall%2F&amp;linkname=Saving%20the%20Doomsday%20Glacier%3A%20Is%20It%20Time%20To%20Build%20A%20Giant%20Antarctic%20Wall%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsaving-the-doomsday-glacier-is-it-time-to-build-a-giant-antarctic-wall%2F&#038;title=Saving%20the%20Doomsday%20Glacier%3A%20Is%20It%20Time%20To%20Build%20A%20Giant%20Antarctic%20Wall%3F\"></a></p>"

The locals quickly took to Father Crespi, who fed the poor and opened schools, a cinema, and several orphanages. As well as the community in Cuenca, Father Crespi cared for the Shuar people, who lived in the rainforest outside town.</p>\n<p>Father Crespi was interested in anthropology. Whenever he had free time, he studied the local cultures. To thank Father Crespi for his work, the Shuar people began bringing him gifts, including artifacts such as thin golden plates with intricate markings and hieroglyphs. He soon built an impressive collection.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Statue of Father Crespi in Cuenca, Ecuador. \" class=\" wp-image-112074\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/shutterstock_1924784405.jpg\" width=\"477\" /><figcaption>Statue of Father Crespi in Cuenca, Ecuador. Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This seemingly endless supply of objects allegedly came from a cave deep in the jungle. The cave featured a massive vertical shaft, deep chambers, and tunnels housing a treasure hoard.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Father Crespi established a museum to display the objects, attracting visitors from near and far. The proceeds went to the poor. Many of the artifacts were obvious fakes, and Father Crespi was aware of this. He purchased them anyway, so that the museum would continue drawing visitors and making money for the poor. His museum included everything from mummies and skulls to armor and tools. Yet, the centerpiece was the \"library\" of metal plates.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"black and white pic of an old bearded man\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112071\" height=\"638\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Image-2026-02-02-at-12.07.37.jpeg\" width=\"864\" /><figcaption>Father Crespi. Photo: Unknown</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Father Crespi, some of the artifacts were as old as the biblical Flood, with plates depicting Egyptian, Assyrian, and Mesopotamian deities and technologies that only emerged thousands of years later.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>However, in the 1960s and 70s, the museum was gutted by fire, suffered frequent thefts, and ran into financial problems. This led to its closure, and the objects were sold to private collectors.</p>\n<h2><b>The cave</b></h2>\n<p>The Shuar's cave, Cuevas de los Tayos, does exist. Each year, the Shuar make a seasonal descent into the cave to capture the oilbirds that nest there. The cave has a plunging 70m vertical shaft, which eventually branches into a network of chambers.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"bw photo of people standing at a cave entrance\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112072\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-02-at-1.35.03-PM.jpg\" width=\"792\" /><figcaption>Old photo from an expedition to the cave. Photo: Ecuador Eco Adventure</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hungarian explorer Janos Moricz organized the first large foreign exploration of the cave. Moricz lived with the Shuar people for a couple of months in the late 1960s while traveling through South America. Here's where the story, unfortunately, starts to involve a lot of conflicting hearsay from conspiracy theorists. Moricz heard stories of a cave filled with treasure and set out to find it. He claimed to have found it in the jungle and described a room filled with golden plates, books covered in symbols, and golden skeletal remains.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Moricz was fascinated by the occult, with some sources speculating he was connected to the Thule Society and the Nazi occult organization Ahnenerbe. His primary focus was to demonstrate that his ancestors (the ancient Hungarians) had reached South America via an ancient land bridge.</p>\n<p>Moricz claimed that the golden library contained etchings associated with ancient Hungarian groups, thus proving his theory. He went to the Ecuadorian government to request funding and expeditionary resources, but was ignored.</p>\n<h2><b>Enter Erich Von Daniken</b></h2>\n<p>By 1969, with his bestselling weirdie book <i>Chariots of the Gods</i>, Erich Von Daniken had become famous for his outlandish theories about ancient cultures interacting with beings from other worlds. Moricz and Von Daniken met, and the latter claimed that Moricz took him into the cave. He described golden books and artifacts, which he naturally believed originated from otherworldly visitors in ancient times.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Father Crespi artefact\" class=\"wp-image-111627 size-full\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-22.42.14.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption>Father Crespi, right, with a tablet. Photo: Unknown</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After publishing another book, <em>The</em> <em>Gold of the Gods,</em> Von Daniken fell out with Morciz, who claimed they hadn't visited the cave together and that Von Daniken had simply recounted a conversation about the cave. This did not look good for either party. However, the book and argument did put Cuevas de los Tayos on the radar of other explorers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Scottish archaeologist Stan Hall led an expedition to the cave in 1976, with the help of the British and Ecuadorian military, and American astronaut Neil Armstrong. They claimed to find evidence of man-made features like doors, but no golden books. However, in an article by writer Dario Brooks for the <em>BBC</em>, geologist Theofilos Toulkeridis explained that what Hall thought were man-made carvings in the rock were actually the result of natural processes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>But that did not deter Hall. He met a gentleman named Petronio Jaramillo, who claimed to have seen the golden library as a child with a Shuar friend. Jaramillo described the library:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Each metal sheet is about 40 x 20 centimeters, and there are about 50 leaves in each book, stamped to form a bas-relief on one side. There are tinges of green in the metal. The sizes of the books vary and, I estimate, from lifting some of them, that they average between 20 and 40 kilograms each.

Hall wrote a book, <em>Tayos Gold</em>, recounting this conversation.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"fake golden tablet\" class=\"wp-image-111628 size-large\" height=\"487\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-22.42.33-700x487.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption>A fake artifact from Father Crespi's collection. Photo: Unknown</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><b>Theories</b></h2>\n<p>American explorer and mystery enthusiast Richard Wingate allegedly saw Father Crespi’s collection in the 1970s before it was sold off:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>In a dusty, cramped shed on the side porch of the Church of Maria Auxiliadora in Cuenca, Ecuador, lies the most valuable archaeological treasure on earth.</p>\n<p>More than one million dollars’ worth of dazzling gold is cached here, and much silver, yet the hard money value of this forgotten hoard is not its principal worth. There are ancient artifacts identified as Assyrian, Egyptian, Chinese, and African, so perfect in workmanship and beauty that any museum director would regard them as first-class acquisitions.</p>\n<p>Since this treasure is the strangest collection of ancient archaeological objects in existence, its value lies in the historical questions it poses and demands answers to.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yet, if the collection was this important, why wasn’t it publicized or snapped up by a major museum? Why haven’t there been more surveys and large-scale searches of the cave and surrounding areas? The details don't add up.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Cuevas de los Tayos is not easily accessible to the public. Though some believe the Shuar have hidden the library's remaining contents -- and the genuine gold bits in Father Crespi's original collection could well have come from some ancient Amazonian culture -- it is much more likely that most of the legend is a hoax.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_111624\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsounds-cool-but-ecuadors-legendary-golden-library%2F&amp;linkname=Ecuador%27s%20Legendary%20%27Golden%20Library%27\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsounds-cool-but-ecuadors-legendary-golden-library%2F&amp;linkname=Ecuador%27s%20Legendary%20%27Golden%20Library%27\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsounds-cool-but-ecuadors-legendary-golden-library%2F&amp;linkname=Ecuador%27s%20Legendary%20%27Golden%20Library%27\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsounds-cool-but-ecuadors-legendary-golden-library%2F&amp;linkname=Ecuador%27s%20Legendary%20%27Golden%20Library%27\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsounds-cool-but-ecuadors-legendary-golden-library%2F&amp;linkname=Ecuador%27s%20Legendary%20%27Golden%20Library%27\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsounds-cool-but-ecuadors-legendary-golden-library%2F&amp;linkname=Ecuador%27s%20Legendary%20%27Golden%20Library%27\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fsounds-cool-but-ecuadors-legendary-golden-library%2F&#038;title=Ecuador%27s%20Legendary%20%27Golden%20Library%27\"></a></p>"

The name \"</span><span>comb jellies\"</span><span> comes from their method of moving</span><span> through the water using rows of hair-like structures called ciliary combs. </span></p>\n<p><span>Scientists believe the species </span><span>came</span><span> to the Adriatic accidentally in the ballast water of cargo ships. A sometime cannibal, it will eat its own young when food is scarce. The bizarre creature has a temporary anus that appears only when it needs to expel waste, then vanishes again. Unfortunately, it is also one of the </span><span>world’s</span><span> top invasive species and is causing chaos for the Italian city's</span><span> fragile lagoon ecosystem. </span></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A close up of a sea walnut moving through the water.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112050\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/shutterstock_2122581548.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption>The Sea Walnut. Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Warm lagoon, happy jellyfish</h2>\n<p><span>The lagoon is almost perfectly suited to its needs, allowing the sea walnuts population to explode at an alarming rate. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771425005566\">recent two-year study</a> </span><span>found that it can thrive in a wide range of temperatures and salinity levels. The species blooms from early spring through to early autumn, when warmer waters and stable salt levels allow it to reproduce rapidly. Researchers note that climate change is fueling the </span><span>jellyfish's</span><span> success in the lagoon and that the situation is likely to worsen.</span></p>\n<p><span>The sea walnut may sound harmless, or even cute, but that is far from the truth. The species devours plankton, fish eggs, and fish larvae, stripping the lagoon of the foundations of its food web. For local fishers, the invasion is already having serious consequences. The gelatinous creatures are clogging up fishing nets, making them heavier, harder to haul in, and less effective. At the same time, fish stocks are crashing because the comb jellies are demolishing most of their fish eggs and larvae.</span></p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_112048\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Finvasion-of-the-sea-walnuts-a-cannibal-jellyfish-takes-over-venices-lagoons%2F&amp;linkname=Cannibal%20Jellyfish%20Take%20Over%20Venice%27s%20Lagoons\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Finvasion-of-the-sea-walnuts-a-cannibal-jellyfish-takes-over-venices-lagoons%2F&amp;linkname=Cannibal%20Jellyfish%20Take%20Over%20Venice%27s%20Lagoons\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Finvasion-of-the-sea-walnuts-a-cannibal-jellyfish-takes-over-venices-lagoons%2F&amp;linkname=Cannibal%20Jellyfish%20Take%20Over%20Venice%27s%20Lagoons\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Finvasion-of-the-sea-walnuts-a-cannibal-jellyfish-takes-over-venices-lagoons%2F&amp;linkname=Cannibal%20Jellyfish%20Take%20Over%20Venice%27s%20Lagoons\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Finvasion-of-the-sea-walnuts-a-cannibal-jellyfish-takes-over-venices-lagoons%2F&amp;linkname=Cannibal%20Jellyfish%20Take%20Over%20Venice%27s%20Lagoons\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Finvasion-of-the-sea-walnuts-a-cannibal-jellyfish-takes-over-venices-lagoons%2F&amp;linkname=Cannibal%20Jellyfish%20Take%20Over%20Venice%27s%20Lagoons\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Finvasion-of-the-sea-walnuts-a-cannibal-jellyfish-takes-over-venices-lagoons%2F&#038;title=Cannibal%20Jellyfish%20Take%20Over%20Venice%27s%20Lagoons\"></a></p>"

Frenchmen <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/remembering-lionel-terray/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lionel Terray</a> and Jean Couzy first summited it on May 15, 1955, followed by six more over the next two days. All used supplemental oxygen</p>\n<p>Marjan Manfreda, 25, of the former Yugoslavia, made the first no-O2 ascent on Oct. 6, 1975, via the South Face. He did not intend a no-O2 ascent, but his gear malfunctioned. His six companions, led by Ales Kunaver, used bottled O2.</p>\n<p>Between 1950 and 1964, all 14 of the 8,000’ers were climbed for the first time, but none in winter. The first winter 8,000m ascent took place on Everest: On Feb. 17, 1980, Leszek Cichy and Krzysztof Wielicki of Poland summited with supplemental O2.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 9, 2009, Denis Urubko and Simone Moro topped out on Makalu. This made Makalu the ninth 8,000m peak climbed in winter, after Everest, Manaslu, Dhaulagiri I, Cho Oyu, Kangchenjunga, <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/the-winter-climbing-history-of-annapurna-i/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Annapurna I</a>, Lhotse, and Shisha Pangma. Thanks to detailed expedition reports, we get a taste of how hard it is to climb an 8,000m peak in winter.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Makalu.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112026\" height=\"919\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4970.jpg\" width=\"759\" /><figcaption>Makalu. Photo: Archil Badriashvili</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Early winter attempts</h2>\n<p>Before the first success, 13 expeditions tried and failed to climb Makalu in winter.</p>\n<p>In the winter of 1980-81, an Italian-Swiss expedition led by Renato Casarotto tried via the southeast ridge, without supplemental oxygen. On Jan. 23, 1981, Romolo Nottaris reached 7,350m before extreme conditions halted his progress. According to The Himalayan Database, it was -48ºC at 7,200m, with heavy snow and strong winds.</p>\n<p>Fierce wind is a recurring theme on Makalu. The 1981 team recalled that the wind often blew at 200kph, shifting directions from south to north and destroying all seven Italian tents. Wind on the ridge was so strong that movement without fixed ropes was impossible.</p>\n<h2>British attempt</h2>\n<p>On November 30, 1981, the British Himalayan Winter Expedition arrived at Makalu Base Camp, led by Ron Rutland. The six-man party aimed to ascend the Makalu La–Northwest Ridge route (normal route) without bottled oxygen. The expedition started off poorly, with porters refusing to go higher because of a lack of snow, leaving the climbers to carry loads.</p>\n<p>Linda Rutland, Alan Deakin, Bill Ryan, and Ron Rutland reached 7,255m on December 19 and left gear at the campsite. Extreme cold on the mountain (-50ºC) and strong westerly winds slowed the team’s progress to a crawl. On December 21-22, Rutland went up again, reaching 7,315m. The team didn't make it any higher. The climbers were exhausted and suffered from altitude sickness. On December 28, they left the mountain.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"When night falls on Makalu.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112027\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4971.jpg\" width=\"763\" /><figcaption>Night on Makalu.

Before Makalu, he made the first successful winter solo trilogy of the great North Faces of the Alps (the Grandes Jorasses, the Matterhorn, and the Eiger). He did the first and only ascent of <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/sole-ascent-mitre-peak/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mitre Peak</a>, solo, in alpine style. He also climbed Aconcagua’s South Face solo. Finally, Ghirardini was a member of the French national expedition to K2, where he bivouacked alone at 8,350m without oxygen, during a solo attempt.</p>\n<p>Ghirardini aimed to summit Makalu via the difficult <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/the-west-pillar-of-makalu-and-why-batards-speed-ascent-is-still-the-fastest/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">West Pillar</a>, alone and without bottled oxygen. Because of extreme cold and strong winds, he didn’t manage to summit. However, it was an amazing effort. He climbed alpine-style with just 120m of rope and a 25kg backpack. He reached 7,000m despite hurricane-force winds and -50˚C temperatures.</p>\n<p>\"The big problem in winter is the wind; snow and rock conditions are good,\" Ghirardini said. \"There is clear weather on many days, there are few avalanches, but very short periods of no wind. The wind sounds like a Boeing.\"</p>\n<p>The wind was at least 150kph and blew the rope horizontal, so he couldn’t rappel down to 7,000m. After this attempt, Ghirardini gave up extreme alpinism.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A closeup of the West Pillar of Makalu. \" class=\" wp-image-112029\" height=\"863\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4974.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><figcaption>The West Pillar of Makalu.

During their attempt, the wind snapped four tent poles, and their base camp tent blew away.</p>\n<p>In their opinion, the route was easy, but the constant strong winds made progress impossible. Two climbers reached their highest point at 7,520m on December 23 but descended directly to Base Camp the next day. The team made no further attempts. Deep snow made the retreat difficult; it was like \"snow-swimming,\" they said.</p>\n<p>That same winter, an Italian-Austrian-French party led by Reinhold Messner attempted the Makalu La-Northwest Ridge route, also without O2. They reached 7,500m before strong winds forced them to abandon the climb.</p>\n<p>In 1986, Japanese climbers Noboru Yamada and Yasuhira Saito attempted the Southeast Ridge without oxygen. On December 9, the duo abandoned their attempt at 7,500m due to bad weather, exhaustion, and a lack of food.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"File image of Makalu's upper sections, shot in spring 2025.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112032\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4981.jpg\" width=\"754\" /><figcaption>File image of Makalu's upper sections, shot in the spring of 2025.

Like the Japanese team, they reached 7,500m before the wind stopped them.</p>\n<p>In the winter of 1990, another no-O2 party, led by renowned Polish climber Krzysztof Wielicki, reached 7,300m on the West Pillar. On December 20, they reached 7,400m on the Makalu La-Northwest Ridge route.</p>\n<p>In January 1997, a no-O2 Spanish team, led by Manuel Gonzalez Diaz, attempted the Makalu La-Northwest Ridge route. They reached a high point of 7,200m three times. Again, it was impossible to reach Makalu La because of the wind. Camp 1 blew away twice, including once when the wind moved a tent in Camp 1 -- with three people inside -- some distance sideways. It was windy every day, with gusts of over 100kph, for 45 days. On February 6, they abandoned the attempt.</p>\n<p>In the winter of 2000-01, Wielicki returned again. This team reached 5,800m on the West Pillar, 6,400m on the South Pillar-South Col route, and 7,100m on Makalu’s northwest side on January 7. Likewise, they abandoned the attempt because of strong winds.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Makalu from the west.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112028\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4964.jpg\" width=\"764\" /><figcaption>Makalu from the west.

Before his solo expedition, he had already summited 11 8,000'ers, often solo or by new routes. He was also well known for a self-rescue on Annapurna’s South Face in 1992 after his climbing partner, Pierre Beghin, died.</p>\n<p>Lafaille arrived on the mountain in late 2005 and spent weeks ferrying loads. After the wind forced several retreats, Lafaille resumed climbing on January 24 after the weather improved. On January 26, he established a high camp at 7,600m, pitching a small tent. Lafaille’s last communication was a satellite phone call to his wife at 4:30 am on January 27. He reported feeling good despite a lack of sleep from the altitude and the cold (down to -30ºC). He said he would push for the summit that day.</p>\n<p>Helicopter searches found only a tent, and high winds limited higher flights. His wife, brother, and Finnish climber Veikka Gustafsson (who knew the route) participated in search efforts. They left supplies at Base Camp in case he returned.</p>\n<p>Later, in the spring of 2006, an Italian expedition spotted a small red tent at 7,600m and a broken tent near a serac at 7,800m. It was too dangerous to approach the tents. Lafaille's body was never found.</p>\n<p>Experts, including Gustafsson, believe Lafaille likely fell into one of the route’s many treacherous crevasses (Gustafsson fell into three on the same route). Winds were not extreme during Lafaille's final push, according to the weather forecasts.</p>\n<p>This month marks the 20th anniversary of Lafaille’s death. (We recommend reading our detailed account of the incident: <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/flashback-lafailles-death-on-winter-makalu/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flashback: Lafaille’s Death on Winter Makalu</a>.)</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The final photo of Jean-Christophe Lafaille, takem at 7,000m on winter Makalu. \" class=\"size-full wp-image-112031\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4977.jpg\" width=\"762\" /><figcaption>The final photo of Jean-Christophe Lafaille, taken at 7,000m on winter Makalu. Photo: Jean-Christophe Lafaille</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Further attempts</h2>\n<p>Two years after Lafaille’s disappearance, a small Italian team attempted the same route, again without bottled oxygen. Nives Meroi, Romano Benet, and Luca Vuerich arrived at Base Camp on January 13, 2008. They reached their highest point (7,000m) on January 28. The trio reported constant strong winds, and only two days (January 16 and January 27) without extremely blustery conditions.</p>\n<p>The team left Base Camp on February 11 and retreated to a camp near Barun Pokhari. Between the two camps, the wind toppled Meroi, who broke her right ankle. Benet and Vuerich had to carry Meroi over the difficult moraine the rest of the way. A helicopter evacuated the team to Kathmandu on February 12.</p>\n<p>That same winter, a Kazakh team also attempted Makalu. Denis Urubko, Gennadiy Durov, Sergey Samoilov, and Evgeny Shutov were on the same route (Makalau La- Northwest Ridge) without bottled oxygen. After establishing Base Camp at 5,600m, they rotated to higher camps. However, illness sidelined Durov, and poor acclimatization forced Samoilov to turn back at 7,200m during a period of good weather.</p>\n<p>On February 1, Urubko, Samoilov, and Shutov reached Makalu La at 7,400m but were met with severe winds. Urubko reported that they were being blown several meters while roped together. They spent a precarious night at approximately 7,350m on a small ledge before attempting to continue on February 2. Soon after, gale-force winds up to 120kph made further progress impossible. They descended to Base Camp.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Simone Moro approaching Makalu's summit.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112034\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4983.jpg\" width=\"759\" /><figcaption>Simone Moro approaches Makalu's summit. Photo: Denis Urubko/Simone Moro</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The first winter ascent</h2>\n<p>In January 2009, Urubko returned to Makalu, this time with Italian Simone Moro. Without bottled oxygen, they completed the first winter ascent by focusing on speed and wind protection.</p>\n<p>On January 20, the duo established their base camp at 5,680m in a gully near the Chago Glacier to shield themselves from the elements. Their acclimatization was rapid. They used a level area of the glacier for an initial bivouac at 6,100m before setting up Camp 2 at 6,800m on a steeper section.</p>\n<p>Rather than following the traditional, sunnier route to the Makalu La, the pair opted for a direct couloir. While colder, this route offered better wind protection and allowed for faster movement. After a reconnaissance climb to 7,350m and shifting some gear, they launched their summit push on February 7.</p>\n<p>The duo moved efficiently, bivouacking at 6,800m and then at 7,600m. On February 9, Urubko and Moro reached the summit in the early afternoon despite wind speeds of 120kph. They maintained a constant rope connection for safety. Racing against an approaching hurricane, they descended to Base Camp by February 10, collecting their gear before the storm hit.</p>\n<p>After 13 failed winter expeditions to climb Makalu, Urubko and Moro had finally succeeded.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Simone Moro's summit photo on winter Makalu. \" class=\"size-full wp-image-112035\" height=\"542\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4984.jpg\" width=\"739\" /><figcaption>Simone Moro's summit photo on winter Makalu. Photo: Denis Urubko/Simone Moro</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The 2024 commercial guided attempt</h2>\n<p>The first commercial winter attempt was organized by Makalu Adventure in 2024. This expedition was the first to use bottled oxygen on a Makalu winter attempt. The team -- composed of Sanu Sherpa, Iranian client Abolfazl Gozali, Pastemba Sherpa, and Sanu’s brother Phurba Ongel Sherpa -- chose the Makalu La-Northwest Ridge route. They reached 7,900m on Jan. 26, 2025, before bad weather halted them.</p>\n<h2>A claimed second winter ascent, and tragedy</h2>\n<p>This winter, Makalu Adventure again organized a commercial guided winter expedition. Sanu Sherpa led clients Abolfazl Gozali of Iran and Piyali Basak of India (who had nearly died on Makalu in 2023), along with a strong group of Sherpas, including Phurba Ongel Sherpa (Sanu's brother), Lakpa Rinjin Sherpa, and others.</p>\n<p>The Sherpas were all experienced on 8,000m peaks, while Gozali had only summited Manaslu as a guided client in 2022 with bottled oxygen. However, Gozali had completed the <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/newcomers-guide-the-snow-leopard-challenge/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Snow Leopard</a> 7,000'ers.</p>\n<p>The expedition reached Base Camp in early January 2026, fixed ropes, and prepared for a summit push amid typical winter challenges like high winds and cold.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Abolfazl Gozali during his winter Maklu attempt in 2025. \" class=\"size-full wp-image-112036\" height=\"803\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4988.jpg\" width=\"828\" /><figcaption>Abolfazl Gozali during his winter Makalu attempt in 2025. Photo: Abolfazl Gozali</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On January 15, Makalu Adventure reported that Sanu Sherpa, Abolfazl Gozali, Phurba Ongel Sherpa, and Lakpa Rinjin Sherpa reached the summit. However, the achievement was immediately overshadowed by tragedy during the descent. Phurba Ongel Sherpa fell to his death from above Camp 4 at approximately 7,500m, and Abolfazl Gozali went missing between Camp 4 and Camp 3.</p>\n<p>We don't know what happened to Abolfazl Gozali. He might have taken a wrong turn while descending toward Camp 3, or he may have fallen into a crevasse. Extreme winds and dangerous conditions hampered rescue teams (and Sanu Sherpa was injured during one search attempt), and the search was eventually <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/no-hope-on-winter-makalu-search-called-off/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">called off</a> on January 22. They had found no trace of Gozali, and Phurba Ongel Sherpa's body was left on the mountain.</p>\n<p>As of late January 2026, no summit photographs or other evidence have been publicly shared by the surviving team members or the expedition organizer.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"File image of Phurba Ongel Sherpa.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112037\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4990.jpg\" width=\"728\" /><figcaption>File image of Phurba Ongel Sherpa.

The land around is utterly deserted of humans. Colomo and Miquel pack enough food for 22 days and plenty of water, as fresh water is scarce along their route.</p>\n<p>Their journey takes them to over 5,000m, into the unique Andean <em>puna</em>. Puna is high-altitude prairie, replete with lush yellow grass, salt flats, small lakes, and wildlife. The puna currently sits at a crossroads between two types of human habitation. Throughout the documentary, Colomo and Miquel stop for the night at abandoned chapels, signs that once someone lived here. But throughout their journey, they find only one family living on the puna, tending to sheep and alpacas.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the mining industry looms like a vulture over the landscape through which they ride.

Many villages celebrate the glorious event: They've been in shadow or darkness since at least November.</p>\n<p>The Arctic Circle is defined as the region where the sun does not rise for one day each year. The farther north you travel, the longer the sun disappears (and, conversely, the longer the summer midnight sun lasts). In the High Arctic, the first sunrise of the year isn't until late January or early February.</p>\n<p>The Inuit hamlet of Clyde River, on Canada's Baffin Island, is just above 70° north and celebrated the sun's return on January 19. More than two degrees closer to the North Pole, Pond Inlet -- Clyde's northern neighbor on Baffin -- had its first sunrise at 12:02 pm on January 28. The sun set again less than an hour later. Several of the world's most northern communities are still eagerly awaiting the sun's first brief appearance.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Sunrise on a high arctic village\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112011\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pond-inlet.jpg\" width=\"1280\" /><figcaption>A pink sunrise over Pond Inlet. Photo: Parks Canada Nunavut</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Even farther north</h2>\n<p>Resolute Bay, a Nunavut hamlet well-known to polar adventurers because it is the last stop for jets from the south, will continue to experience the Arctic night until February 4. It is about another two degrees further north than Pond Inlet, and its Inuktitut name, Qausuittuq, means \"place where the sun doesn't rise.\"</p>\n<p>Nunavut's northernmost civilian settlement, Grise Fiord on Ellesmere Island, has to wait even longer. Their roughly 144 citizens will see the sunrise on February 10. At over 76 degrees north, Grise Fiord's Arctic night started in early November. The days aren't completely without light, though: Even in the depths of winter, a faint orange glow is visible to the south at noon.</p>\n<p>The longer the polar night, the faster the transition to polar day. By April 1, Grise Fiord's nights won't be dark enough to see any stars. From April 22 to August 20, the sun won't set at all.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Qaanaaq Greenland\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112023\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Qaanaaq2.jpg\" width=\"638\" /><figcaption>Qaanaaq, Greenland, shortly before the polar night sets in. Photo: Jerry Kobalenko</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Leaving Nunavut for Greenland, a few communities will wait even longer for their sunrise. In Qaanaaq, 77°28′ north of the equator, the polar night ends on February 17. Though it is the largest of Greenland's far north towns, Qaanaaq's population of humans, around 600, is outnumbered by its <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/greenland-hunters-bred-sled-dogs-with-wolves-for-strength/\">sled dogs</a>.</p>\n<p>In these small High Arctic settlements, the return of the sun is a time for celebration. Many communities hold festivals or ceremonies, like Pond Inlet's February 9 <span class=\"x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x1lliihq x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xudqn12 x3x7a5m x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xzsf02u x1yc453h\" dir=\"auto\">Return of the Sun Festiva</span>l. In Qaanaaq, many elders take off one mitten and hold their bare hand (briefly) up to the sun when it first appears.</p>\n<p>Though the sunshine is welcome, it typically signals even colder temperatures, with the bitterest Arctic weather occurring in the weeks after polar night ends.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_112010\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fin-high-arctic-villages-the-sun-is-returning%2F&amp;linkname=In%20High%20Arctic%20Villages%2C%20the%20Sun%20is%20Returning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fin-high-arctic-villages-the-sun-is-returning%2F&amp;linkname=In%20High%20Arctic%20Villages%2C%20the%20Sun%20is%20Returning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fin-high-arctic-villages-the-sun-is-returning%2F&amp;linkname=In%20High%20Arctic%20Villages%2C%20the%20Sun%20is%20Returning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fin-high-arctic-villages-the-sun-is-returning%2F&amp;linkname=In%20High%20Arctic%20Villages%2C%20the%20Sun%20is%20Returning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fin-high-arctic-villages-the-sun-is-returning%2F&amp;linkname=In%20High%20Arctic%20Villages%2C%20the%20Sun%20is%20Returning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fin-high-arctic-villages-the-sun-is-returning%2F&amp;linkname=In%20High%20Arctic%20Villages%2C%20the%20Sun%20is%20Returning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fin-high-arctic-villages-the-sun-is-returning%2F&#038;title=In%20High%20Arctic%20Villages%2C%20the%20Sun%20is%20Returning\"></a></p>"

Tordeur and Sevestre described the wind as the strongest they had experienced during their expedition, so powerful that they dropped down to their smallest kites (7 and 4m², respectively). Eventually, they even had to take a windbound day inside their tent.

After kiting all day, they were just 40km from their pickup point and were skiing down a long slope. About halfway down, Kathinka’s sled caught between sastrugi, which stopped it dead, while the kite pulled her forward. She suffered three pelvic fractures and a fractured rib.</p>\n<p>A medical team evacuated the Gyllenhammars from Antarctica a few hours later. Kathinka is recovering in Chile.</p>\n<h2>Antarctic crossing</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/antarctica-roundup-2025-2026-kite-skiers-arrive-soon-at-hercules-inlet/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Last week</a>, we noted that Colin O’Brady had slowed around 87°. He recently provided some context: \"87°S kicked my ass, with shoulder-high sastrugi [an exaggeration] for 70 miles, and damn it got cold,\" he wrote on his Instagram.</p>\n<p>Yet conditions on the polar plateau should improve, certainly when compared with the Reedy Glacier. \"The Reedy glacier was by far the scariest and most dangerous section of the route. A few [times] my feet punched through into crevasses...I really feared for my life,\" O'Brady wrote.</p>\n<p>Antarctica Logistics &amp; Expeditions (ALE) has confirmed that O'Brady completed \"the first solo ascent of the Reedy Glacier,\" according to their records. O'Brady's other claim, that he is the \"first person to cross the Ross Ice Shelf solo and unsupported,\" is more complex. Here is what ALE had to say:</p>\n<p>\"According to our records, Colin [O'Brady] is the third solo unsupported crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf that ALE has provided logistics for, after Borge Ousland in 1996 and Hoddi Tryggvason in 2025. All three have had different travel styles. Ousland completed the first solo crossing of Antarctica from Berkner Island via the South Pole to Ross Island with a mix of manhauling and assistance using parawings. Tryggvason has recently completed an unsupported solo snow-kiting expedition.\"</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Colin O'Brady takes a break on a convenient sastrugi wave.\" class=\" wp-image-112014\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-30-at-10.31.01-1.jpg\" width=\"558\" /><figcaption>O'Brady takes a break on a convenient sastrugi wave.

He took a rest day on January 28 but reports feeling healthy, bar a few minor complaints: \"The biggest pains I have in my body are my fingers, which are now super cracked from the cold, dry air. My right thumb, especially. I put Super Glue in all the cracks every night.\"</p>\n<h2>Other expeditions</h2>\n<p>Scott Pallett and Bill Kwok have climbed a new route on the western face of Mount Erebus (3,792m). The pair skied from Ross Island before climbing Mount Erebus, the world's southernmost active volcano.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DT7kI0rkvPg/?img_index=1\" style=\"line-height: 0;

Many good-looking berries and fruits in our tropical rainforests can give your stomach a hard time if you’re naive enough to ingest them without knowing the species. But there’s one particular fruit every Caribbean child is warned about. The manchineel tree looks innocent enough, with its bright green skin and smooth surface. But just being near it can land you in the hospital.</p>\n<h2><b>History</b></h2>\n<p>Long before the arrival of the Spanish, the indigenous tribes of the Caribbean knew about the deadly powers of the manchineel. They used its toxic sap to take down their enemies, either by poisoning their water or coating their own arrowheads. They used the same techniques to trouble the European newcomers. But sometimes, hungry or careless explorers would bite into the fruit with no idea of what was coming next.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"manchineel tree at the beach\" class=\"wp-image-111949 size-large\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2149358219-700x467.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption>Just standing under the manchineel tree is dangerous. Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 1493, Christopher Columbus recorded how his men reacted to it. He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were wild fruits of various kinds, some of which our men, not very prudently, tasted; and on only touching them with their tongues, their mouths and cheeks became swollen, and they suffered a great heat and pain.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He called it the “little apple of death” or “manzanilla de la muerte.” Years later, Juan Ponce de Leon was in the middle of a brutal skirmish with natives in Florida and sustained a fatal injury from an arrow. He was taken to Havana, where he succumbed to his wound. Legend has it that the arrowhead was dipped in manchineel sap.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Captain Cook himself encountered it during one of his voyages when he and his men were at the point of desperation. Seeing the fruit, his men did not hesitate to take a big chomp from the juicy flesh. Others cut down parts of the tree for firewood. Soon after, the men felt the ill effects. Some went blind for a short time after rubbing their eyes. The vomiting, blistering, and blindness eventually wore off.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Background</b></h2>\n<p>The manchineel (<em>Hippomane macinella</em>) resembles a small, green apple and carries the nickname “beach apple.” It is usually found along the coastlines of the southern United States, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. However, it also lives in swampy or mangrove areas. The tree can grow up to 15m tall, its bark is greyish-red, and its broad green leaves look like any other tropical tree you might want to seek shade under. However, many manchineel trees come with an ominous warning sign nailed to the bark or even red stripes painted on them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"manchineel tree warning\" class=\"wp-image-111948 size-large\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2149358401-700x467.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption>A warning on the manchineel tree in Curaçao. Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You cannot touch any part of it or shelter underneath it. Its leaves, fruits, bark, and even the air surrounding it can cause severe reactions, including painful blistering, conjunctivitis, and temporary blindness if it comes into contact with the eyes. It is also important that you do not stand under the tree when it rains, as the drops become contaminated with the sap.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>If consumed, you’d spend a few agonizing days vomiting with diarrhea, low blood pressure, dehydration, and searing pain in the throat. In severe cases, you can also experience abdominal bleeding and lung issues. All animals except the black-spined iguana and the Galapagos tortoise steer very clear of this tree. Both seem able to eat and shelter under the tree with no ill effects.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2>What makes it so dangerous</h2>\n<p>What makes this tree so dangerous is the milky sap that coats every part of the tree and harbors some of the world’s most menacing toxins. These include phorbol esters, furocoumarins, sapogenines, hippomanins, and mancinellin. Phorbol esters, in particular, are responsible for blistering and inflammation of the skin. Furocoumarins have the same effect, but only when activated by UV rays. If the fruit is ingested, hippomanins can cause intense pain and damage to the stomach.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Among the notable cases of manchineel poisoning: In 2000, British radiologist Nicola Strickland and her friend were vacationing in Tobago when they came across the fruit. They took a bite of the manchineel but didn’t swallow. Sadly, just tasting it was enough to ruin their holiday. She wrote later:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I rashly took a bit from this fruit and found it pleasantly sweet…Moments later, we noticed a strange peppery feeling in our mouths which gradually progressed to a burning, tearing sensation and tightness of the throat. The symptoms worsened over a couple of hours until we could barely swallow solid food because of the excruciating pain and the feeling of a huge obstructing pharyngeal lump.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The symptoms subsided in eight hours, and she noted that milk helped the burning sensation considerably.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"blistering from manchineel tree\" class=\"wp-image-111950 size-large\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Munoz_3-700x594.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption>Blistering on the skin after exposure. Photo: Maria Munoz, Scott Whitecar, and Scott A. Norton</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Another victim</h2>\n<p>American botanist Richard A. Howard also had a run-in with the manchineel during a trip to Montserrat in 1979. He stated that, though he came into close contact with the manchineel several times in the past without any effects, this time something was different. Sap dripped onto his forehead without him realizing it. He soon felt burning in his eyes and blurred vision. Said Howard:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>My eyes were bloodshot and the lids swollen for four or five days…without medical treatment, I might have suffered the fate of blindness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He sought immediate medical intervention, and his symptoms eased.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Are there any uses at all?</b></h2>\n<p>If handled correctly and processed with even greater care, the manchineel serves several purposes. Throughout the West Indies, carpenters dry the wood out for several days so the sap dries. Then, they can use the wood to make furniture. Also, if the gum from the tree is processed, it can be used to treat edema and other ailments.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Leave it be</b></h2>\n<p>As far as we know, no one has died from the manchineel. You might be wondering, why don’t we just get rid of it? It’s easier said than done. The manchineel is a double-edged sword. First of all, it’s an endangered species. If we get rid of it, the mangroves and beaches lose a vital source of protection from erosion, since the trees act like windbreakers. The manchineel-proof iguana and tortoise would also lose a food source.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>You can’t touch it. So why not burn it? If you burn the tree, the smoke will burn your eyes and skin and inhibit breathing. There’s no safe way to dispose of it.</p>\n<p>When you see it, just leave it alone.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_111946\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fdont-be-fooled-by-how-innocent-it-looks-this-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-tree%2F&amp;linkname=Don%27t%20Be%20Fooled%20by%20How%20Innocent%20It%20Looks%3A%20This%20is%20The%20World%27s%20Most%20Dangerous%20Tree\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fdont-be-fooled-by-how-innocent-it-looks-this-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-tree%2F&amp;linkname=Don%27t%20Be%20Fooled%20by%20How%20Innocent%20It%20Looks%3A%20This%20is%20The%20World%27s%20Most%20Dangerous%20Tree\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fdont-be-fooled-by-how-innocent-it-looks-this-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-tree%2F&amp;linkname=Don%27t%20Be%20Fooled%20by%20How%20Innocent%20It%20Looks%3A%20This%20is%20The%20World%27s%20Most%20Dangerous%20Tree\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fdont-be-fooled-by-how-innocent-it-looks-this-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-tree%2F&amp;linkname=Don%27t%20Be%20Fooled%20by%20How%20Innocent%20It%20Looks%3A%20This%20is%20The%20World%27s%20Most%20Dangerous%20Tree\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fdont-be-fooled-by-how-innocent-it-looks-this-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-tree%2F&amp;linkname=Don%27t%20Be%20Fooled%20by%20How%20Innocent%20It%20Looks%3A%20This%20is%20The%20World%27s%20Most%20Dangerous%20Tree\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fdont-be-fooled-by-how-innocent-it-looks-this-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-tree%2F&amp;linkname=Don%27t%20Be%20Fooled%20by%20How%20Innocent%20It%20Looks%3A%20This%20is%20The%20World%27s%20Most%20Dangerous%20Tree\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fdont-be-fooled-by-how-innocent-it-looks-this-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-tree%2F&#038;title=Don%27t%20Be%20Fooled%20by%20How%20Innocent%20It%20Looks%3A%20This%20is%20The%20World%27s%20Most%20Dangerous%20Tree\"></a></p>"

It lies about 30km north of Villa Manihuales in Chilean Patagonia.</p>\n<p>The route, named <em>Sin obstaculos no hay camino</em> (\"No obstacles, no path\"), spans 600m across 17 pitches. It features a varied range of crack climbing, including fissures of various sizes, chimneys, off-width sections, and technical face climbing that links different crack systems. The difficulties range from 5+ upward, with several pitches in the 5.11 and 5.12 range. Two pitches go as high as 5.13, though these can be aided at A1.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The new bigwall route on La Zaranda.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-111997\" height=\"1091\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4857.jpg\" width=\"828\" /><figcaption>The new big-wall route on La Zaranda. Photo: Raimundo De Andraca</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The two climbers dedicated several days to cleaning the line and equipping it for safety. The wall stands close to the Carretera Austral (Route 7). The base is just 250m from the road — 15 minutes on foot.</p>\n<p>La Zaranda remains a relatively undeveloped big-wall venue in the region. The new route of De Andraca and Carabias is only the third recorded route on the formation, according to <a href=\"https://www.planetmountain.com/en/news/climbing/raimundo-de-andraca-fernanda-carabias-establish-new-climb-la-zaranda-patagonia.html\">PlanetMountain</a>. Its roadside location and quality of climbing should draw future interest from the climbing community.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DT0rBDWCdDd/?igsh=MWJpYzd5dHcxMzJ5Yw%3D%3D\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DT0rBDWCdDd/?igsh=MWJpYzd5dHcxMzJ5Yw%3D%3D\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">See this post on Instagram</a></p></div></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_111994\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fnew-multi-pitch-route-opened-in-chilean-patagonia%2F&amp;linkname=New%20Multi-Pitch%20Route%20Opened%20in%20Chilean%20Patagonia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fnew-multi-pitch-route-opened-in-chilean-patagonia%2F&amp;linkname=New%20Multi-Pitch%20Route%20Opened%20in%20Chilean%20Patagonia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fnew-multi-pitch-route-opened-in-chilean-patagonia%2F&amp;linkname=New%20Multi-Pitch%20Route%20Opened%20in%20Chilean%20Patagonia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fnew-multi-pitch-route-opened-in-chilean-patagonia%2F&amp;linkname=New%20Multi-Pitch%20Route%20Opened%20in%20Chilean%20Patagonia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fnew-multi-pitch-route-opened-in-chilean-patagonia%2F&amp;linkname=New%20Multi-Pitch%20Route%20Opened%20in%20Chilean%20Patagonia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fnew-multi-pitch-route-opened-in-chilean-patagonia%2F&amp;linkname=New%20Multi-Pitch%20Route%20Opened%20in%20Chilean%20Patagonia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Fnew-multi-pitch-route-opened-in-chilean-patagonia%2F&#038;title=New%20Multi-Pitch%20Route%20Opened%20in%20Chilean%20Patagonia\"></a></p>"

Huntford wrote bestselling biographies of Ernest Shackleton, Fridtjof Nansen, and Robert Falcon Scott, as well as nonfiction works on the history of skiing and our cultural perceptions of snow.</p>\n<p>A controversial figure in polar exploration history, Huntford's work transformed the narrative of Captain Scott and the race to the South Pole. His exact birth date is hard to verify, but Huntford was born in the year 1927, making him 98 or 99 at the time of his death.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Two book covers\" class=\"size-full wp-image-111988\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-29-112658.jpg\" width=\"924\" /><figcaption>Two editions of Huntford's bestselling work comparing Scott and Amundsen. Photo: Internet Archive</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>A complicated figure</h2>\n<p>While much of his life was spent writing biographies, his own is quite obscure. According to his own account, Huntford's father was an English gentleman, and his mother was a Russian woman. They met before the Russian Revolution and settled in South Africa, where Huntford was born. Later investigation by polar explorer (and Huntford critic) Ranulph Fiennes found that Huntford was the son of two Lithuanian immigrants to South Africa. He changed his name from Horowitz to Huntford at the age of 32.</p>\n<p>Huntford spent his youth in various careers, including a stint in Geneva working for the UN. Based on his later comments, he left the organization on somewhat bad terms. By the early 1960s, he was making his living as a correspondent for magazines like <em>The Observer. </em>In 1974, he interviewed Tryggve Gran, the only Norwegian on Robert Falcon Scott's South Pole expedition, and then one of its final survivors.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Page of a 1974 interview\" class=\"size-full wp-image-111989\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Those-Who-Dared-Tryggve-Gran-interview-with-Roland-Huntford.jpg\" width=\"653\" /><figcaption>Photo: Observer Colour Magazine, hosted by Those Who Dared</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Huntford later recalled that his editor read the story and told him there was a book in it. Five years later, Huntford published <em>Scott and Amundsen. </em>Alternatively titled <em>The Last Place on Earth</em>, it was an immediate success. It became a television show in 1985. It was a completely different version of the Scott story than anyone had read before, depicting Scott, formerly a tragic hero, as an incompetent leader and an unlikable, difficult man.</p>\n<h2>Lasting influence on the genre</h2>\n<p>Later writers like Fiennes criticized Huntford's work, particularly his influential Scott biography. Huntford had no personal experience in the polar regions, and he consistently alienated the friends and family of deceased explorers. Scott's son, Peter, actually brought legal action against Huntford and won.</p>\n<p>Huntford's work as entertainment, however, has enjoyed a better reception even among critics. Fiennes found his work \"very well written, in the style of an exciting novel.\" His modern, entertaining biographies revive public interest in polar exploration. His staunch opposition to the dominant narrative, if perhaps lacking in historiographical nuance, helped trigger a broader re-examination of how the Heroic Age of exploration is remembered.</p>\n<p>Even Roland Huntford's strongest detractors could not deny that the world of polar history has lost a man of massive impact.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \"><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button class=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_post_btn_111986\" type=\"button\"></button><span class=\"count-box wp_ulike_counter_up\"></span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Froland-huntford-polar-history-author-has-died%2F&amp;linkname=Roland%20Huntford%2C%20Polar%20History%20Author%2C%20Has%20Died\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Froland-huntford-polar-history-author-has-died%2F&amp;linkname=Roland%20Huntford%2C%20Polar%20History%20Author%2C%20Has%20Died\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_tumblr\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Froland-huntford-polar-history-author-has-died%2F&amp;linkname=Roland%20Huntford%2C%20Polar%20History%20Author%2C%20Has%20Died\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tumblr\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Froland-huntford-polar-history-author-has-died%2F&amp;linkname=Roland%20Huntford%2C%20Polar%20History%20Author%2C%20Has%20Died\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Froland-huntford-polar-history-author-has-died%2F&amp;linkname=Roland%20Huntford%2C%20Polar%20History%20Author%2C%20Has%20Died\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Froland-huntford-polar-history-author-has-died%2F&amp;linkname=Roland%20Huntford%2C%20Polar%20History%20Author%2C%20Has%20Died\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorersweb.com%2Froland-huntford-polar-history-author-has-died%2F&#038;title=Roland%20Huntford%2C%20Polar%20History%20Author%2C%20Has%20Died\"></a></p>"

New research suggests they also carried a mobile toolkit during their mountain travels.</p>\n<p>Caverna Generosa, a 1,450m-high cavern in the Lombard Prealps of northern Italy, is commonly known as the bear cave. Over the last few decades, researchers have found hundreds of bear skeletons inside it, built up over thousands of years. Alongside them lay 16 stone tools.</p>\n<p>This modest selection of stone tools tells us a great deal about the ancient humans who visited the cave. First, it seems that these tools were not made in the cave itself. There is a complete absence of flakes, chips, and debris you'd expect if that's where the tool was manufactured. Instead, chemical analysis shows that they are made of high-quality flint and radiolarite from an area a few kilometers away and lower down.</p>\n<p>In addition to the lack of flakes and chips, microscopic analysis suggests the tool owners resharpened the edges several times.

By profession, he worked as a Field Service Technician for CenturyLink, a home internet provider. He was also working towards a degree in Computer Science at Western Governors University. Off the clock, climbing was where his care for others and his values showed most clearly.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119205\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119205\" height=\"823\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0-1.jpg?width=730\" width=\"770\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \">(Photo: Courtesy of Adara DeNiro)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Robbie enjoyed many adventures in some of Utah’s most beautiful places: American Fork Canyon, the Cottonwood Canyons, Maple Canyon, and Rock Canyon, where he once climbed the popular route <em>Cosmic Space Dust Lazers</em> (5.9; 1,000ft) with Manny Rivera Marquez. On colder days, he could often be found in Salt Lake’s Momentum Climbing Gym with his partner, Adara DeNiro. They also ventured to Puerto Rico together, where he took on local limestone climbs and connected with the climbing community.</p>\n<p>By nature, Robbie was quiet; he didn’t need many words to make an impact. Those who climbed with him remember his calm presence, intelligence, and as someone that always looked out for others. He prioritized safety above everything. One of Robbie’s beliefs was simple and sincere: “More love equals more good.” He showed this in his actions, both on and off the wall.</p>\n<p>On May 8, after many years of struggle, Robbie lost his battle with his mental health. Remembering Robbie means honoring both his joy and his hardship, and continuing the conversations around mental health that help keep our community connected and compassionate. After his passing, the University of Utah introduced the <a href=\"https://studentresources.utah.edu/ourscholarships.php\">Robert Anson Carroll Memorial Scholarship</a>, which is dedicated to financial support for computer science majors approaching graduation.</p>\n<p><em>Read the full tribute to Climbers We Lost in 2025 <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/community/climbers-we-lost-2025/\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119206\"></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/community/robert-anson-carroll/\">Young Utah Climber Is Remembered for His Calm Presence, Intelligence, and Care for Others</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com\">Climbing</a>.</p>"

Last week, the 29-year-old casually announced his first ascent of <i>Duality of Man</i>, a 100-foot cave route near Tucson, Arizona that includes a V15 crux. He proposed the grade 5.15d, the sport’s all-time top grade—the same suggested for Adam Ondra’s <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/videos/adamondrasilence/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Silence</i></a>, Sébastien Bouin’s <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/interview-seb-bouin/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>DNA</i></a>, and Jakob Schubert’s <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/jakob-schubert-proposes-worlds-third-5-15d/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>B.I.G</i></a>.</p>\n<p>But his announcement, timed to the upcoming premiere of a <a href=\"https://mellowclimbing.com/pages/mellow-film-tour\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">film</a> about the ascent, came more than 11 months after his actual send—and in the easy, understated way that we’ve come to expect from one of climbing’s most insouciant crushers. “It feels like a lifetime ago,” Bailey tells <i>Climbing</i>. He has to scroll back in his camera roll to confirm the actual send date of March 6, 2025. “It’s funny, I haven’t really thought about it too much until just now.”</p>\n<p>This level of nonchalance feels out of place against the intense work ethic that sending 5.15d demands. Yet Bailey neither downplays his efforts nor shrugs off the route’s historic difficulty. “I’ve never climbed something so close to my limit,” he admits. “It was just so much harder than anything I’ve done.” <i>Duality of Man</i> took three full seasons to project, and the final season included nearly two months of almost-sending. By the end, his confidence simmered down to pure discipline. “I knew I was going to do it,” he says. “I just didn’t respect how much luck I was going to need.”</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119145\"><img alt=\"Sean Bailey makes the first ascent of 'Duality of Man' (5.15d) in Dry Canyon, Arizona.\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119145\" height=\"1917\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Sean-Bailey-Duality-of-Man-15d-PH_-Ben-Neilson_0207-scaled.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\"><em>Duality of Man</em> adds an additional V11/12 boulder and V15 boulder to <em>Lee Majors</em> (5.14c). </span>(Photo: Ben Neilson)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>The next big thing</h2>\n<p>Bailey’s journey to <i>Duality of Man</i> began in Celebrity Cave, a scooped-out hunk of golden limestone in Arizona’s Dry Canyon. Picture a Mediterranean grotto pulled from the ocean and planted on a desert bluff. Back in 2018, Bailey’s fellow World Cup competitor <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/coleman-didnt-believe-olympic-finals-then-won-silver/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nathaniel Coleman</a> made the first ascent of <i>Lee Majors</i> (5.14c), a burly roof climb and the hardest in the cave. Later, Coleman bolted an extension to <i>Lee Majors</i>, called <i>The</i> <i>Six Million Dollar Man</i>, that exits the cave and moves up a 25-degree headwall via slippery pockets. In late 2021, he invited Bailey to come check it out.</p>\n<p>At the time, Bailey was coming off a record season on both plastic and rock. He’d won three of the eight World Cups he’d competed in, then flown to Céüse, France, to check out the hardest route he’d ever done: Alex Megos’s <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/stefano-ghisolfi-downgrades-bibliographie-5-15c/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Bibliographie</i></a> (5.15c). In 24 sessions—his longest process, at the time—he walked away with the third ascent in September 2021. “Since then, I’ve invested a lot more time in projecting and refining my processes tactically,” he says.</p>\n<p>The first winter on <i>The Six Million Dollar Man</i>, which Bailey would eventually rename <i>Duality of Man</i>, was a “recon mission.” Bailey focused exclusively on the headwall, where he discovered a V11/12 boulder, a rest, and a 12-move V15 crux. “The actual meat of it is five really hard moves,” he says. That first season, he sent the crux in isolation and committed to the project. But it took a second winter season to figure out how to arrive at the crux with enough power left over from <i>Lee Majors</i>—what Bailey describes as “this energy game.” On its own, the 5.14c requires multiple dynos; it’s easy to get exhausted. However, by early 2023, he was having a lot of “good tries” on the full link-up, making it all the way to the final boulder before he fell.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119148\"><img alt=\"Sean Bailey makes the first ascent of 'Duality of Man' (5.15d) in Dry Canyon, Arizona.\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119148\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Sean-Bailey-Duality-of-Man-15d-PH_-Ben-Neilson_07936-scaled.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Using various weather apps, Sean Bailey timed his attempts on <em>Duality of Man</em> to match the greatest difference between the temperature and dewpoint. </span>(Photo: Ben Neilson)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>One last season</h2>\n<p>Bailey can’t quite remember why he skipped <i>Duality of Man</i> during the 2023-2024 winter—perhaps to go on a bouldering tear that included sending his first V17, <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/watch-sean-bailey-send-shaolin-v17/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Shaolin</i></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/the-9-biggest-climbing-moments-2024/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Devilution</i></a> (V16), with a right-hand throw that elite boulderer Keenan Takahashi described as “top five hardest [moves] in the world.” He’d retired from competition climbing in late 2023, and by the time he returned to Tucson for the 2024-2025 winter season, he’d spent an entire year on rock. “I had been thinking about [<i>Duality of Man</i>] all the time,” he says.</p>\n<p>After settling into his friend Ben’s house in Tucson and spending two weeks re-learning the moves on <i>Duality</i>, Bailey narrowed in on the details of his redpoint process. It had been a notoriously hot year for Tucson, with more than 112 days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In the winter, Celebrity Cave faced the sun all day, and the only hours that were climbable were just before dusk.</p>\n<p>Bailey would start his days slowly, driving an hour from Tucson and hiking up for 30 minutes in the afternoon. Just as the sun was going down, he’d begin his warm up and try to send the crux boulder in one burn. “That was usually my first little test to see if I was feeling good,” he says. Then he’d come down, rest, and try for a send go, making just one full try per day. He also experimented with timing his tries for the highest gap between the temperature and the dewpoint—a measurement that he started to believe was more useful than humidity.</p>\n<p>When he wasn’t checking the dewpoint or making attempts on the route, Bailey spent his rest days working on his laptop at home. He and his partner, Olympic silver medalist <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/miho-nonaka-sends-mr-hyde-ceuse-france/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Miho Nonaka</a>, had just rented a space in Tokyo to build a new bouldering gym, and there was a ton of work to prepare for its opening. “I was doing a bunch of wall designing and picking holds out,” he says, adding that the work was far from relaxing. “On the ‘off’ days, I’d just work all day, and on the ‘on’ days, I’d go try the route and it would fucking suck and I’d fall off it. I look back on it fondly, but it was hectic.”</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119146\"><img alt=\"Sean Bailey makes the first ascent of 'Duality of Man' (5.15d) in Dry Canyon, Arizona.\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119146\" height=\"1917\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Sean-Bailey-Duality-of-Man-15d-PH_-Ben-Neilson_0229-scaled.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">&#8220;I was fully committed, but it was a weird head space,&#8221; says Sean Bailey about <em>Duality of Man</em>. &#8220;I had a lot of tries that just felt so perfect, and I was confused why I didn’t do it. They were the type of tries where if you have them, you do the route.&#8221; </span>(Photo: Ben Neilson)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>The waiting game</h2>\n<p>The process of working <i>Duality of Man</i> was so unpredictable that it challenged even Bailey’s patience. “It’s always the same process of, you don’t know you can do it, and it’s fun, and you’re learning, and everything’s improving,” he says, “and then you hit this switch. The switch always comes from that single idea: <i>I can do this</i>. After you have that thought, everything changes and you’re in it.”</p>\n<p>In January 2025, that switch arrived. Bailey finally had a nearly flawless try, where he made it through all of <i>Lee Majors</i>, past the first boulder, and through the crux—right up to the last move. “Ben [Neilson] had always been joking at me that I’d fall on this move,” says Bailey, laughing. “I was telling him not to put it in the ether. And then I fell, and I was like, ‘You fucking dick, dude.’” For next two months, Bailey lived with a constant and nagging certainty: he knew he <i>could</i> 100% do the route, but didn’t know what day, if any, he <i>would</i>.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119149\"><img alt=\"Sean Bailey makes the first ascent of 'Duality of Man' (5.15d) in Dry Canyon, Arizona.\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119149\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Neilson-07370-scaled.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">&#8220;It&#8217;s just a phrase I like,&#8221; says Sean Bailey about the name &#8220;Duality of Man.&#8221; He adds that it fits with the original name, as the Six Million Dollar Man was a half-man, half-cyborg in eponymous 1970s TV show.</span> (Photo: Ben Neilson)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>March 6, he says, was just another day. Nothing special or momentous hinted at the send. Bailey got through <i>Lee Majors</i> with decent efficiency, then pulled the first five moves of the lower crux. There was a small reset where he collected his mind. “It was the second time I’ve been up there,” he says. “I was like, all right, this is finally the fucking moment. I can finally take control of the situation again, and I’m just going to make it happen.” He powered through the V15, held on through the last move, and after four years of work, finally clipped the chains.</p>\n<p>Then he shut up about it. Instead of reveling in the glory of sending America’s hardest proposed route, Bailey decided to reserve his big public announcement until the film was ready to show. His reason was surprisingly practical. “I think in today’s age, the hype moment only happens once,” he says. “Trying to make sure that was decently close to the film coming out kind of made the most sense.” He adds that funding the film was a priority, and he really wants his photographer, Neilson, to get paid for his work. For the next 11 months, he processed the accomplishment in private, with no social media reactions to boost or dampen his satisfaction. Overall, he calls this “a good thing.”</p>\n<p>On May 4, 2025, Bailey and Nonaka opened their new gym, <a href=\"https://www.nextgen-bouldering.com/en/about\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Next Gen Bouldering</a>, in the outskirts of Tokyo, and it’s been keeping them busy since then. “A lot of my energy has been going into setting and all the usual stuff that goes into a gym, but on the backend, I’ve been trying to go on some trips, too,” says Bailey. In November, he flew to Switzerland and made the second ascent of Aidan Roberts’s <i>Arrival of the Birds</i>, marking Bailey’s third V17. This spring, he’s planning to sport climb at the Red River Gorge in Kentucky. “I’m psyched on everything, but just trying to make sure I’m investing enough time in all the things I’m trying to do,” he says. We can’t wait to hear about his future sends—even if we have to wait a year to celebrate.</p>\n<p><i>Tickets for the Mellow film tour, which premieres in Boulder, Colorado, on February 27, are </i><a href=\"https://mellowclimbing.com/pages/mellow-film-tour\"><i>available now</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/how-sean-bailey-sent-duality-of-man-and-why-he-kept-quiet/\">How Sean Bailey Sent America’s First 5.15d—And Why He Kept Quiet</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com\">Climbing</a>.</p>"

Thomas Hostetler was on the leftmost variation of <i>Devil’s Kitchen Headwall</i> (AI3; 800ft), a line on the south side of Hood, on Sunday, January 25. He was with a partner, but the two were climbing unroped. At 9:45 a.m, other climbers on the mountain called 911 after seeing Hostetler tumble roughly 300 feet down the wall.</p>\n<p>Paige Baugher of Portland Mountain Rescue (PMR) was one of the rescuers who responded to the incident. Baugher and other PMR rescuers were already on the mountain conducting training exercises and reached the scene of the accident quickly. However, by the time she found Hostetler at the base of the route, he was deceased.</p>\n<h2>How did Thomas Hostetler end up on <i>Devil’s Kitchen</i>?</h2>\n<p>Ty Siepert was one of Thomas Hostetler’s best friends. He told <i>Climbing</i> that although Hostetler was an avid backcountry skier and hiker, he had no real climbing experience aside from bouldering in a gym a few times. He was far out of his comfort zone climbing a technical ice route. “This was way out of his skill level to do with no safety measures, free solo,&#8221; Siepert said.</p>\n<p>Another friend, John Black, told <i>Climbing</i> that Hostetler had never even been in a belay system. “He didn’t own climbing shoes, a harness, or an ATC,” Black said. “The last link I sent him was Black Diamond’s combo starter kit.” Although Hostetler had spent plenty of time in the mountains, his “climbing” experience, Black said, was limited to non-technical snow routes, like the standard routes on Mount Adams (12,276ft) or Shasta (14,179ft). He’d climbed Hood before, too, but not by a vertical, fifth-class route.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_119136\"><img alt=\"Four climbers ascend snow on Mount Hood, shortly before a novice climber dies free soloing.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-119136\" height=\"1676\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Ty-Siepert.png?width=730\" width=\"998\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Hostetler and Shingleton (rightmost party) approach <em>DKV1, </em>with the party they passed just above them.</span> (Photo: Courtesy Ty Siepert)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>After the accident, Siepert spoke with Hostetler’s climbing partner, James Shingleton. Shingleton reported he and Hostetler had reached the first belay station on <i>DKV1</i> to find it occupied by another two-person party preparing to lead up the first pitch. In order to not wait around, they decided to climb past the other team unroped.</p>\n<p>It was unclear if they planned to stop to belay at all, or just continue soloing to the summit. “It sounded like there was no clear plan as to when or if they were going to rope up,” Siepert said.</p>\n<p>Siepert <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/1qplmu5/my_close_friend_died_free_soloing_mt_hood_the/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">startd a Reddit thread</a> in the wake of Hostetler’s death, and accounts from the two climbers in the other party were subsequently posted to the thread. Both said Hostetler and Shingleton passed and began climbing ahead of them unroped without any warning or communication, and noted that the two climbers were only carrying a 6mm tagline, so it seemed unlikely that they intended to set up a traditional belay. They added the incident could have easily been a double or triple fatality, as Hostetler nearly fell on top of them.</p>\n<p>“I was belaying behind a rock feature and could not see uphill, but seconds later I heard a big sound and watched a body rolling downhill fast, maybe a yard or two away from my partner,” the belayer, Andre Piwoni, wrote. “&#8230; My partner could have been seriously injured or killed by impact if he decided to start climbing several seconds earlier.…”</p>\n<p>Siepert said there was no clear reason why Hostetler had fallen. According to Shingleton, “Thomas just kind of ‘stood up’ on his crampons for a second,” and lost grip on his tools. “I think it was probably just to readjust, his arms probably weren’t really used to holding ice tools on vertical terrain,” Siepert explained. “So there was a momentary lapse, he kind of turned around to look at something, and all of a sudden he slipped.”</p>\n<p>Black and Siepert said that Hostetler also didn’t know Shingleton very well. The two men had met only a couple of weeks before. In a post to the Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwmountaineering\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Northwest Mountaineers</a>, Shingleton claimed that he had “overestimated Thomas’s ability” and said that the decision not to rope up had been Hostetler’s, not his. “Never let go of your tools,” he added. “Every climber knows that. It still does not make it any easier.”</p>\n<h2>What do the rescuers have to say?</h2>\n<p>Baugher, the rescuer who found Hostetler’s body, has been climbing on Hood for 20 years, and has worked with PMR since 2018. She said if pitched out, <i>DKV1</i> typically goes at around three to four pitches of AI3, but added that it&#8217;s not unusual for experienced climbers to solo the route.</p>\n<p>Although the weather on the day of the incident was stellar—clear skies, only light wind—she said conditions on the route itself were poor. “It’s a record low snow year,” Baugher said. “It almost looks like late summer on the upper mountain right now. When I’ve climbed [<i>DKV1</i>], when it’s in, the approach is a snow ramp right up to the base. It doesn’t look like that up there now. The approach was steep, almost vertical. There’s a bunch of exposed rock, and it’s incredibly icy. Just a lot more treacherous than I&#8217;ve seen it in the past.”</p>\n<p>She added that there was also an abnormal amount of icefall coming off the route on the day of the accident.“Usually these routes will shed in the spring, when the sun hits them, or if it&#8217;s really windy, but I was seeing a lot of shedding up there early in the morning,” she said. “I got hit by a giant iceball that I wasn&#8217;t expecting, and it was only ten o&#8217;clock. The mountain just isn’t glued together right now.”</p>\n<p>Hood has a number of entry-level alpine routes, but Baugher said the increase in winter traffic is primarily occurring on the peak’s more technical routes. She noted that this is actually the second death on Hood in a little over a month, and that the other occurred under similar circumstances and conditions.  Matthew Aldridge, 26, was climbing <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106202622/wyeast\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Wy’East Face</i></a>, which typically forms as a moderate, 45-degree snow line, with two partners on December 13. When his partners decided to turn back, Aldridge continued on alone. He never made it back to the trailhead. His body was discovered three days later, below the neighboring Newton Clark Headwall. “It’s not clear what happened because he was by himself, but the thought is that he slipped,” Baugher said. She added that on that day, too, the conditions on Hood were extremely icy.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_119138\"><img alt=\"Portland Mountain Rescue workers lower a rescue litter down the icy terrain on Mount Hood's lower flanks.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-119138\" height=\"2523\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DKv1-photo-4-scaled.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Portland Mountain Rescue workers lower a rescue litter down the icy terrain on Mount Hood&#8217;s lower flanks.</span> (Photo: Portland Mountain Rescue)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As a rescuer, Baugher said her message to the public is that winter ascents shouldn&#8217;t be underestimated, even during high pressure windows that can make conditions appear more optimal than they are. Her comments also illustrated that climbing unroped is always a gamble, even on easy routes.</p>\n<p>Siepert said his friend’s death made him reconsider his perception of free soloing. On Reddit, he noted that Hostetler’s death occurred on the same weekend that Alex Honnold completed a widely celebrated <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/alex-honnold-biggest-urban-free-solo/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">livestreamed free solo of Taipei 101</a>, a skyscraper in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>“I know it comes with the sport, but I’m concerned with the culture,” Siepert wrote. “Maybe it’s just I’m part of that 1% of climbers that experience grief like this, but why do we celebrate a lack of safety?”</p>\n<h2>“A friend that would do anything for you”</h2>\n<p>Hostetler was born in California and raised in Georgia. At the time of his death, he was living in Portland, and had worked for a year and a half as a registered nurse at the pharmacy chain CVS. His mother, Darlene Hostetler, is also a nurse. She told <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2026/01/portland-nurse-who-died-in-mt-hood-fall-remembered-as-genuinely-good-person.html\"><i>The Oregonian</i></a> that her son had wanted to pursue a career in the field since he was a young teen.</p>\n<p>“He came to my work and met all my co-workers, and saw all the love that the nurses were showing me, and heard my stories of how I connected with my patients,” Darlene Hostetler said. “He never even considered another career. He knew that that’s what he was meant to do.”</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_119139\"><img alt=\"Thomas Hostetler at home in Oregon at sunset. \" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-119139\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JTB03280_Original-scaled.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2048\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \">(Photo: John Black)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>“Thomas was one of those friends that would do anything for you,” Siepert told <i>Climbing</i>. “Like, at John’s birthday party, he was out of town for work and flew back that day, then drove eight hours throughout the night and hiked through the dark to meet us at our campsite, just to surprise him. He would do anything for fun and adventure, and being with the people he loved.”</p>\n<p>Black said that because Hostetler’s family was across the country, in Georgia, he often spent holidays at Black’s house. “For Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, Thomas was at our house with our family. He was like a brother.” Although the pair only met around two years ago, Black said their bond was immediate and strong: “It felt like we were lifelong friends.”</p>\n<p>“Obviously Thomas died doing something that he loved, but the results have been hard,” Siepert added. “There&#8217;s a lot of hurt people right now.”</p>\n<p>A friend and colleague of Hostetler’s from CVS, Sarah King-Brown, has set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-for-tommy-hostetlers-family\">GoFundMe</a> to help cover funeral costs and the transport of his body back home to Georgia.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/novice-dies-free-soloing-oregon/\">Friends Question Why Novice Climber Who Died on Mount Hood Was Free Soloing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com\">Climbing</a>.</p>"

She crouched down till her eyes were nearly level with mine. “How sweet,” I thought to myself as she squeezed my arm tighter. “She wants to be at the same height as me.”</p>\n<p>The reality? We were at 12,590 feet on the summit of Mount Conness in the Sierra Nevada mountains, and she was desperately trying not to tumble off the peak’s 800-foot north face. Despite my failure to find a flatter spot to propose, Syd replied with two incredible words: “Of course!”</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119118\"><img alt=\"how to propose on a summit: a man kisses a woman atop a peak\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119118\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lovell-Summit-Proposal-38-scaled.jpeg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \">The author and Syd atop Mt. Conness (Photo: Courtesy Zach Lovell)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Two of our friends, Andrew and Sara, joined us that day. As our irreplaceable confidants, they carried out their crucial roles flawlessly. Equipped with a high-resolution camera on an auto setting, Sara rapid-fired the shutter button. Meanwhile, Andrew took a flurry of pictures and videos with a cell phone to ensure we captured every moment.</p>\n<p>All four of us enjoyed summit Champagne in disco-tiled flutes and a pint glass from the brewery where Syd and I went on our first date. As the sun set during our second-class descent, I confessed my original plans for this mountain proposal: a Himalayan expedition with a helicopter approach. But Plan A kept getting pushed back, causing an 18-month delay in my engagement bid. As we watched the sky turn a vibrant rainbow of pastels over the mountain range where Syd grew up, she simply replied, “This was perfect… and exactly what I wanted.”</p>\n<h2>Summit proposals: A growing trend?</h2>\n<p>As climbing inches further into the mainstream, I’ve seen summit proposals and roped-up engagements skyrocket in popularity. Social media posts, news articles, even a cliff-side wedding feature on The Weather Channel—popping the question on a summit seems to be everywhere these days. And why not? Can you picture a more idyllic setting for such a pivotal question?</p>\n<p>Before you plan out your engagement day with your partner, follow these crucial do’s and don’ts I garnered from my own proposal climb. I also share insights from friends who’ve also gotten down on one knee in the mountains. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about how to propose on a summit.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119120\"><img alt=\"an engagement ring on a finger with a mountain view\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-119120\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Casey_Carolynn-6-768x1024.jpeg?width=730\" width=\"768\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Nothing brings out the beauty of an engagement ring like a tape glove </span> (Photo: Carolynn Hubbard)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>How to propose on a summit</h2>\n<h3>Most importantly, pick the right objective</h3>\n<p>Where you propose is the most crucial aspect of a summit engagement. My fiancée Syd self-identifies as a “non-climber,” but she loves scrambling and moderate fifth class climbing in the alpine. She’s also become obsessed with bagging the SPS (Sierra Peaks Section). The Sierra Club arbitrarily compiled this list of 247 summits in the Sierra Nevada in 1955.</p>\n<p>Mt. Conness (12,590 ft) and the neighboring North Peak (12,248ft) made for a perfect link-up day. Both SPS peaks have classic moderate routes leading to their respective summits. Syd topped out on Mt. Conness with plenty of energy to spare—and looking just as bubbly as she did at the trailhead.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119122\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119122\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lovell-Summit-Proposal-21-scaled.jpeg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">The author&#8217;s support crew and fiancee to-be on Mt. Conness</span> (Photo: Courtesy Zach Lovell)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An engagement day isn’t the time to climb the toughest route you or your partner have ever done. This is a day that will be special for reasons far beyond the hike or the climb itself. It’s also worth considering what season your partner would want for an engagement. “I would have preferred to be proposed to on snow, since skiing is more my thing,” Amber Chilcott said, alongside her husband and co-owner of Valhalla Mountain Guides, Connor Chilcott.</p>\n<p>Connor proposed to Amber on the summit of Eichorn Pinnacle, in Yosemite’s Tuolumne Meadows. He had dreamed of using the spire as his engagement location since he was a teenager. “When I was 19, I first climbed Cathedral peak,” Connor explained. “I looked over at Eichorn Pinnacle and thought, <i>If I ever wanna get married, I’m going to propose there</i>.” While Amber doesn’t identify as a rock climber, Eichorn Pinnacle offers some friendly routes. Connor staged a friend of his on top of the nearby summit of Cathedral Peak to get the perfect shot.</p>\n<p>As you’re combing through potential mountains or routes, don’t be afraid to keep it simple. Sometimes it’s much easier to propose on a scenic second-class hike than during a <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/winning-climbing-love-stories-dirtbag-love-contest/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">long multi-pitch climb</a>. That’s especially true if you live far from the mountains or aren’t both intermediate or advanced climbers. If you or your partner are new to climbing, but you still want a dramatic backdrop, consider a non-technical summit hike in a place like Colorado, where there are plenty of 14ers to choose from. Just make sure you acclimatize properly; nothing ruins an engagement like altitude sickness.</p>\n<h3>Make photos a priority (if that’s important to you)</h3>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119124\"><img alt=\"how to propose on a summit, a man proposes to a woman on top of a rock spire\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-119124\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Connor-and-Amber-Chilcott-Engagement-Photos-683x1024.jpeg?width=683\" width=\"683\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Engagement photos don&#8217;t get much more epic than this—Connor proposing to Amber atop Eichorn Pinnacle in Yosemite. </span>(Photo: Ben Harclerode)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Besides your partner’s answer to the question, there might not be anything more important with an engagement than the photos. “Scout your proposal location ahead of time,” Connor Chillcott suggested. “Figure out exactly where your photographer should be, and where you’re going to get on one knee.”</p>\n<p>For some, having a photographer as part of the team is either not possible or not wanted. “I loved that our new little secret stayed between us until we were back in cell-phone service,” climber Carolynn Hubbard shared about her engagement to her now-husband, Casey Hubbard, on a spire called “Zowie” in Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>\n<p>If you do end up keeping the engagement to just the two of you, try to take as many photos of the day as possible. “I wish I had a few more pictures of the proposal, but I’ve always been awful at taking pictures on adventures,” Carolynn shared.</p>\n<p>If you’re not bringing along photographer friends, you could also try <a href=\"https://dancarrphotography.com/blog/2017/07/15/ultimate-lightweight-tripod-setup-backpacking-camera/\">setting up a tripod</a> or GoPro to set up to capture the moment while keeping it as an intimate group of two. If you’re the one proposing, see if you can climb the pitch to the top first, or make your way to the summit first to set something up before your partner gets there.</p>\n<p>For Syd’s and my engagement day, having our friends there with us felt like a luxury, since they were able to capture the proposal from multiple angles and ensure no moment was missed. They also helped us take photos throughout the entire day, from car-to-car. A high-resolution camera is not essential, but if you or a friend has one, it is definitely worth bringing along. While it can be challenging to orchestrate without dropping a hint, try to encourage your partner to wear layers, a helmet, and other gear that you know they love that day.</p>\n<h3>Safety first, love second</h3>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119126\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-119126\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lovell-Summit-Proposal-11-1024x683.jpeg?width=730\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Make sure you&#8217;re not forgetting to prioritize safety and stay level-headed during the excitement of an alpine engagement.</span> (Photo: Courtesy Zach Lovell)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While there is never a good day to have a climbing accident, it would be especially bad if it happened on your engagement day. Be conservative, and choose a route well within your abilities. Even if you’re an experienced climber, keep calm and take your time. Sometimes the adrenaline and nerves of getting engaged can mess with your mindset, making you prone to cutting corners and mistakes.</p>\n<p>“I saw a thunderstorm approaching and I was nervous, so I started rushing,” Connor Chillcott confessed of his summit engagement. “I pre-threaded the rappel on top of the Eichorn and ended up proposing to Amber without even being tied in.” Amber chimed in, “Yeah, that’s an absolute don’t do.”</p>\n<p>Want to propose on a technical objective, but aren’t an expert climber? Consider hiring a guide or bringing along a more experienced friend for the day. They can even double as the photographer. That lets you focus on your job: popping the question. If you can spend a bit more money, hire one of the climbing photographers across the U.S. that’d be glad to help out with your big day. High-resolution images will come out better in print than photos taken with a cell phone.</p>\n<p>For some, it’s really just about getting a spicy roped-up engagement photo. Propose wherever, then schedule a shoot after you get a “yes.” You can find a cliff closer to the car. Involve a climbing photographer who can help you get the most outrageous shot possible.</p>\n<h2>Chase a climbing proposal with a climbing wedding</h2>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119127\"><img alt=\"getting married on a summit\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-119127\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Casey_Carolynn-2-768x1024.jpeg?width=730\" width=\"768\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Casey and Carolynn below South Early Winters Spire in Liberty Bell, WA after tying the knot on its summit.</span> (Photo: Nate Pakula)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While certainly more challenging to carry out with non-climbing guests, some climbing engagements have even led to climbing weddings or elopements. After getting engaged on Zowie spire, Carolynn and Casey Hubbard tied the knot on the summit of South Early Winters Spire in Washington’s Liberty Bell area.</p>\n<p>“Of course we had to get married on a rock; nothing else made sense,” Carolynn reminisced. “We had the perfect little ceremony at the top, exchanged silicon wedding rings, took photos, and headed down.” Their friend Nate Pakula officiated the elopement, and Carolynn found some last-minute witnesses. “In the parking lot, two strangers signed as our witnesses on our marriage license and shared some Champagne out of Solo cups,” she recalls.</p>\n<p>Wherever you pop the question, just remember: If it doesn’t go perfectly, it’ll make for an even more memorable day. Find an appropriate climb, take lots of photos, be conservative, and most importantly, enjoy it. This&#8217;ll be one of the best days of both of your lives.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/how-to-propose-on-a-summit/\">How to Propose on a Summit, According to 3 Couples Who&#8217;ve Done It</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com\">Climbing</a>.</p>"

Some were legends, others were pillars of their community, all were climbers. Read the full tribute to Climbers We Lost in 2025 <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/climbers-we-lost-2025/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</i></p>\n<h2>Helmut von Microys, 91, December 4</h2>\n<p>Helmut von Microys, a pioneering Canadian climber, passed away on December 4, 2025 at the age of 91 years old. The routes he developed and his community leadership defined the growth of climbing across Southern Ontario.</p>\n<p>A longtime member of the Alpine Club of Canada and a pillar of its Toronto Section, von Microys was born in Austria. After immigrating to Canada, he earned a PhD in civil engineering from the University of Toronto. From the late 1950s onward, he acted as a driving force in the development of Southern Ontario climbing.</p>\n<p>Across the Niagara Escarpment, von Microys established routes around Rattlesnake Point, Metcalfe, Kelso, and Mount Nemo. On the Escarpment alone, he bagged 75 first ascents. His desire to strengthen others came through not only in his community involvement, but in the steady increase in grades he set, up to 5.9. At the time, this pushed the difficulty of climbing in the region.</p>\n<p>Still, von Microys’s most enduring legacy lies at Bon Echo Provincial Park. Between 1964 and 1978, he and his partner Michael Rosenberger completed 34 first ascents on the exposed granite overlooking Mazinaw Lake. The difficulty of those routes expanded the region’s skill once more, reaching as high as 5.11. It also helped position Bon Echo as one of Ontario’s bedrock crags.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119108\"><img alt=\"Helmut von Microys\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-119108\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/helmut-calvin-klatt-1024x900.jpg?width=730\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \">(Photo: Courtesy Calvin Klatt)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In 1967, von Microys was selected to lead the Mount Ontario expedition in celebration of Canada’s Centennial. After multiple attempts, his team completed the ascent in a single 40-hour push. This exhaustive and celebrated effort is remembered amongst friends and the provinces’ climbing history.</p>\n<p>“Helmut was already a legend when I began climbing,” said Calvin Klatt, an Ontario climber and longtime Alpine Club of Canada organizer. “Still, he would climb with the most experienced people and the least.”</p>\n<p>His contributions extended well beyond route development. In 1978, he and his brother Wilhelm played a pivotal role in constructing the ACC Toronto Cabin in Canmore. Now known as the Pat Boswell Cabin, this structure continues to serve as a central hub for the region’s climbers. Together with Gisele, he hosted countless potlocks, discussions and slideshows, often sharing expensive wine with friends, visiting climbers and anyone eager to learn.</p>\n<p>That same thoughtfulness defined his life beyond climbing. While courting Gisele in the early 1960s, Helmut once sent her a letter written on birch bark. He wrote to her in German, their shared language, from a survey camp in Northern Ontario. It remains one of her fondest memories of him.</p>\n<p>In the early 1980s, Von Microys helped establish the Ontario Rock Climbing Association to develop regional safety standards and guidelines. His long-standing commitment to equipment safety and organizational leadership earned him the ACC Distinguished Service Award in 1990. In 2021, he was named an Honorary Member of the Alpine Club of Canada in recognition of a lifetime devoted to climbing and community service.</p>\n<p>Across a lifetime of summits worldwide, Helmut von Microys is remembered as a patient teacher and a foundational presence. His legacy and influence continues across Ontario, in its crags, cabins, and communities. He is survived by his wife Gisele, and their daughter Rion, son Robert, and five grandchildren. A celebration of his life is planned for later this year at Bon Echo.</p>\n<p><i>Read the full tribute to Climbers We Lost in 2025 <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/climbers-we-lost-2025/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</i></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/community/helmut-von-microys/\">Legend of Ontario Lives on Across Canadian Crags, Cabins, and Communities</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com\">Climbing</a>.</p>"

He quietly made a meaningful impact on the climbing and global communities.</p>\n<p>On December 31, Noorani died while descending The Citadel, a 13,000-foot peak west of Denver. According to reporting in <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/01/15/shafiq-noorani-the-citadel-colorado-climber-death/88166968007/\"><i>USA Today</i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/shafiq-noorani-death-citadel-peak-partner-rescue/\"><i>CBS News</i></a>, Noorani fell several hundred feet in a tragic accident. Rescuers described him and his climbing partner as experienced and well-prepared. The exact cause of his fall remains unknown.</p>\n<p>Born in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and raised in Chicago from a young age, Noorani discovered a lifelong love for the outdoors early on. After meeting mountaineer Don Worsham in the 1990s at a Chicago gear store, the two became fast friends, climbing in Wisconsin’s Devil’s Lake and planning expeditions abroad. But they also collaborated to make a positive impact around the world.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119102\"><img alt=\"Shafiq Noorani climbing\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-119102\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/shafiq-noorani_matt-brooks-769x1024.jpg?width=730\" width=\"769\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \">(Photo: Courtesy Matt Brooks)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Together, Noorani and Worsham enlisted the support of IBM in the late `90s to deliver donated computer equipment to  children at underprivileged schools in Nepal. Many of the schools they helped were originally founded by <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/edmund-hillary-first-to-climb-everest-and-avid-philanthropist/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sir Edmund Hillary</a> and sorely in need of upgrades. Noorani often combined his mountaineering adventures with efforts like these.</p>\n<p>Noorani later trained as a physician assistant. He pursued medical missions in Nepal, South America, South Africa, and Tanzania, while continuing to climb and explore. After moving to Colorado, he embraced the mountains fully. He lived simply, fishing, climbing, and quietly making connections everywhere he went. As Worsham said, “He never gave his heart to one person &#8211; he gave little pieces all over the planet.”</p>\n<p>A longtime climbing partner, Matt Brooks, recalled, “Shafiq was experienced, exceptionally safe, conscientious, and possessed a level of kindness and patience with others that I could only respect and admire. He was a great reminder that who you’re on the mountain with matters just as much as your own technical ability.”</p>\n<p>Noorani’s life was defined not by peaks conquered, but by the care, curiosity, and generosity he brought to every climb, every mission, and every friendship. His absence will be felt in the mountains, in classrooms, and in the countless lives he touched around the globe.</p>\n<p><i>Read the full tribute to Climbers We Lost in 2025 <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/climbers-we-lost-2025/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</i></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/community/shafiq-noorani/\">The Denver Climber Who Died in a New Year’s Eve Fall Had a Huge Heart</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com\">Climbing</a>.</p>"

He shared facts about flora, fauna, geology, and astronomy, as well as how to move efficiently, from hiking and skiing, to, of course, climbing.</p>\n<p>Like many climbing notables, he first put boot to stone at Stoney Point. Jerry also enjoyed fishing, SCUBA diving, and a recreational lifestyle with his wife Sigrid, family, and friends. Over many decades, “The Climbing Family Andersons” made hundreds of notable first ascents and contributions to several Yosemite and surrounding area guidebooks. Jerry was always planning and prepping for the next outing and route he’d spied.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, Jerry moved into Yosemite’s Camp 4, employing “Iron Age” gear and tactics to climb big walls. In the `70s, he put in time with <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/when-yosemite-search-and-rescue-loses-one-of-its-own-niels-tietze/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yosemite Search and Rescue (YOSAR)</a>, while embracing the then new lighter weight “clean climbing” ethos. This became the “Aluminum Age.”</p>\n<p>As the popularity of climbing in the `80s and `90s grew (and up until his passing), Jerry saw the value of creating quality bolted routes—where crack protection was scant, sketchy, or non-existent. His emphasis was always safe fun at all grades and fun for all climbers, regardless of experience or ability. Endorsing and practicing the principles of the <a href=\"https://safeclimbing.org/\">American Safe Climbing Association (ASCA)</a>, he also volunteered his time and energy for approach trail and climbing route maintenance.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119085\"><img alt=\"Jerry Anderson climbing\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-119085\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jerry_Unnamed_TD_1-768x1024.jpg?width=730\" width=\"768\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Tamed but unnamed—this one look like it&#8217;s gonna &#8220;go!&#8221; </span> (Photo: Courtesy Larry Arthur)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In each climbing discipline, Jerry’s assessment of risk management and assurance of reward stayed top of mind. This held true whether he was climbing with friends or working for guide outfits, including Yosemite Mountain Guides and Southern Yosemite Mountain Guides. On snow, he worked as a Level 3 Instructor at various ski resorts and was well known as a Trainer for the Professional Ski Instructors of America. In all outdoor disciplines, he most enjoyed helping others improve their education, experience, and skills in order to “move on up.”</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119086\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119086\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jerry_After_Climbing_Layback_1.jpg?width=730\" width=\"1266\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Jerry enjoying the post-climb layback while contemplating his next route</span> (Photo: Courtesy Larry Arthur)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Always inquisitive, never complacent, Jerry was constantly exploring, expanding his knowledge base, surrounding himself with friends, and forging the best path forward. Always onward and always “up.” In recent years (before the “big C” took final hold), he and Sigrid would host semi-annual gatherings. Folks would come together for a long weekend of climbing and tell even longer stories around each night’s fire. These climbing campouts made lasting memories, lifelong friendships, and the best partners.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119087\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119087\" height=\"936\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jerry_-Sugar_Pine_-Grahm_2.jpg?width=703\" width=\"703\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Jerry standing straight and tall, just like one of the &#8220;big ones.&#8221; </span> (Photo: Courtesy Grahm Doe)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Jerry made his home near Yosemite<b>. </b>It served as the perfect basecamp and launch pad for pursuing his passions in the Sierras: new route-aineering, trout fishing, hiking, backpacking, and come winter, skiing.

Read the full tribute to Climbers We Lost in 2025 </i><a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/community/climbers-we-lost-2025/\"><i>here.</i></a></p>\n<h2>Carlos Suárez, 52, April 1</h2>\n<p>In a tragic set of circumstances, Carlos Suárez, a longtime climber, BASE jumper, and wingsuit pilot, was killed in a wingsuit accident while filming a movie about his own life. The crash occurred on April 1, 2025, just as the 52-year-old Spaniard was filming stunts for the movie “La Fiera” (The Beast), a film that chronicles his friendship with four other pioneers of wingsuit flying and proximity flying in Spain. Today, of that group of five friends, only Armando del Rey is still alive.</p>\n<p>“Carlos was an idol for us, a force of nature, someone very confident who didn&#8217;t want to end up like he did,” said del Rey, while acknowledging that, perhaps, it is unrealistic to speak of safety when referring to wingsuit flying, a constantly evolving sport with many unknowns still to be explored. “Carlos jumped, but his barometric parachute didn&#8217;t open. He could have manually deployed the reserve parachute, but he didn&#8217;t. I think he must have fainted mid-flight, or suffered some similar incident that prevented him from pulling the ripcord,” del Rey said.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_119060\"><img alt=\"Carlos Suarez climbing in Patagonia.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-119060\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0567.jpg?width=730\" width=\"1068\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \">Carlos Suárez climbing in Patagonia. (Photo: Oscar Gogorza de Carlos)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like many climbers of his generation, Suárez first fell in love with mountaineering through its literature. He devoured the classics, seeking to understand both mountaineering’s evolution and his own place in that world. He eventually became an avid climbing writer, too, contributing articles for numerous magazines and sections of books.</p>\n<p>One of his first major climbs came when he was barely 17 years old. He arrived wide-eyed in Chamonix and free soloed the storied North Face of the Grandes Jorasses via its <i>Cassin Route</i> to the Walker Spur. He later repeated the <i>Bonatti Pillar</i> of Les Dru. Climbing partners described Suárez has having the energy of an exploding rocket; fast, committed, and audacious.</p>\n<p>Many other solo ascents followed, sometimes with ropes and sometimes without, free soloing 8a (5.13b) sport routes like <i>Cazaprimeras</i> in 1996. Suárez was acutely aware that mountaineering was a breeding ground for premature deaths, a danger he chose to face with physical excellence, technique, and calculation, but without sacrificing adventure, the true driving force of his passion. Climbing without a rope might have seemed like madness, but it was, in reality, an act of calculated honesty, thought out and dissected to achieve complete fulfillment.</p>\n<p>Despite these values, Suárez’s passion for mountaineering began to fade with the passing years. It had begun to feel too narrow of a path for him, a theater where he repeated variations of the same play, a risky, unique work… but always similar. At the beginning of this century, he seemed like an artist without a stage, a person in transit toward some destination no one seemed to foresee. He was a man with many questions and few answers, someone tied to his glorious youth as a star of the vertical world and, at the same time, needing a connection to a future he couldn&#8217;t quite imagine. Should he be like everyone else? Look for a family, a home, a stable job—simply vanish?</p>\n<p>BASE jumping came to rescue him from his self-absorption, gifting him a renewed, unknown, fresh passion. How many people are fortunate enough to find two passions in the same life? He understood that in the mountains, the extreme only leads to a dead end: addiction or a premature death. He needed new ways to express himself, however much they might have the familiar flavor of a known game. With BASE jumping, some would say, fate still hung in the air.</p>\n<p>The easiest explanation would have been that Suárez was simply swapping one addiction for another, one type of adrenaline rush for the latest trend. The real challenge lies in understanding what benefits come from engaging in so-called extreme activities. Suárez never knew. Nevertheless, curiosity drove him to action: it was no longer about exposing himself to emulate his idols, to prove his abilities, to feed his ego, but simply to gain some understanding. He wasn&#8217;t seeking feats, but answers, a glimmer of comprehension. To know, at the very least, what our purpose is in this world.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/carlos-suarez-the-alpinist-determined-to-live-an-authentic-life/\">Carlos Suárez, the Alpinist and Wingsuit Pilot Who Was Determined to Live an Authentic Life</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com\">Climbing</a>.</p>"

Last Friday, January 23, the Minneapolis Climbing Cooperative <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DT1LG1jEdOy/?hl=en\">called upon its community</a> not to purchase a pass; the co-op is also <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DT_g38rEW-Q/?hl=en\">hosting a fundraiser</a> for community members impacted by ICE on January 31.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119026\"><img alt=\"an ICE OUT sign in Minneapolis\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-119026 size-full\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257859434-Anthony-Souffle--scaled.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Anti-ICE signs on display on Central Avenue in Northeast Minneapolis</span> (Photo: Anthony Souffle / The Minnesota Star Tribune via Getty)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On January 26, training board company Kilter <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DT_nzsRASKR/\">announced on Instagram</a> that it would shut down operations on Friday. “We believe that climbing cannot exist outside of politics, and that we cannot turn a blind eye to what’s happening in the U.S. and the current regime,” Kilter wrote in its post.</p>\n<p>The following day, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DUB4x5xj9Jx/\">Tension Climbing echoed</a> that sentiment in a similar Instagram post, declaring that “in solidarity with the ongoing strikes,” it would temporarily halt all business transactions on Friday.</p>\n<p>Both board companies are based in Colorado, a state where ICE has arrested <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2025/12/31/ice-arrests-2025-data-deportation-data-project/\">more than 3,500 people</a> in 2025. A federal judge recently issued a preliminary injunction against ICE making warrantless arrests in Colorado in a class-action lawsuit, <a href=\"https://www.aclu-co.org/press-releases/federal-judge-prohibits-ice-from-making-warrantless-arrests-in-colorado/\">according to the ACLU</a>. Tension Climbing is based in Denver, while Kilter is headquartered in Boulder, with a manufacturing facility in Louisville.</p>\n<p>With around 15 employees, Kilter told <i>Climbing </i>that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTlDFLaDQAA/\">a viral post</a> from Minnesotan pro climber Kyra Condie about the situation in her home state sparked deeper conversation within the company about taking action. Brendan Scorpio, who leads marketing and setting at Kilter, shared that the company’s first step was to reach out to people in Minnesota to ask about the best way to offer support. Following an internal conversation, the company decided to join the January 30 shutdown.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119028\"></figure>\n<p>On Friday, Scorpio plans to be out in Denver in solidarity with local organizations participating in the nationwide strike. He noted that other Kilter employees might choose to show up for a demonstration as well, or just take the day to decompress.</p>\n<p>“We believe that climbing is political in the sense that so many things that are political affect people’s day-to-day lives,” Scorpio says. “Physically pulling on a climbing hold is not political, but the idea of having access to rock, access to gyms, and understanding that climbing is a community, and if members of that community are under attack for any reason, then it affects the whole community.”</p>\n<p>Kilter co-founder and chief operations officer Jackie Hueftle explains, “Living without acknowledging politics is privilege.” She adds that Kilter is known for being open about active issues. More commonly, the company shows up through charitable giving and fundraising.</p>\n<p>In the last two weeks, several more pro climbers against ICE violence have also spoken out about the escalating immigration control situation. Following the murder of Renee Good, Eddie Taylor, a climber and schoolteacher from Minnesota, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQTlWaEapu/\">shared a post</a> that began with, “This is not a climbing post.” He wrote, “ICE does not make communities safer. They do not maintain order. They do not protect us.” A few days later, on January 13, he followed that post with a black-and-white image of climbers ascending a ladder over a crevasse simply titled: “F*CK ICE.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQTlWaEapu/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Eddie Taylor (@alldayeddie)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DT_Th9iD56r/\">Tommy Caldwell shared</a> that while he typically avoids stepping into politics, at the present moment, silence has begun to “feel like violence.” While he didn’t directly reference ICE, the situation in Minnesota, or any specific political issue, he invited comments from the community about whether people like him who “have a voice” bear a responsibility to use it at this moment in time. One of Caldwell’s sponsors, Patagonia, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DUEJXz0ksem/\">recently posted on Instagram</a> that it was donating to organizations identified by its store in St. Paul, as well as writing to senators in every state where it has employees.</p>\n<figure class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone\" id=\"attachment_119029\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119029\" height=\"1819\" src=\"https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257519559-Selcuk-Acar-scaled.jpg?width=730\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption class=\"pom-caption \"><span class=\"article__caption\">Anti-ICE demonstrators in NYC&#8217;s Union Square on January 24</span> (Photo: Selcuk Acar / Anadolu via Getty)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Overwhelmingly, comments encouraged Caldwell to use his voice and weighed in on the political situation in the U.S. right now. “The moment you recognize you have a voice, you use it,” wrote Teresa Baker, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.insolidarityproject.com/about\">In Solidarity Project</a>, which works to create more diversity and inclusion in the outdoors. In another comment on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DT_Th9iD56r/\">Caldwell’s post</a>, British climber Hazel Findlay wrote that she wished Alex Honnold had “whipped out” a “Fuck Trump” banner at the top of Taipei 101 last weekend.</p>\n<p>On January 28, <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/anna-hazelnutt-big-wall-madagascar/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Hazlett</a>, who also goes by Anna Hazelnutt, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DUDnFEjjuTi/\">posted that </a>if her followers support ICE, her content isn’t for them.

At the time, Durand pointed out that the exact boundaries of the “archeological zone” versus the “protection zone” were unclear, and that more clarity was needed from the Department of Culture. The mayor of Peramola, Joan Puig, also spoke out against the decree on January 11, telling <a href=\"https://diaricatalunya.cat/en/alt-urgell/general/peramola-defends-climbing-at-roc-del-rombau-against-culture-department-restrictions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Diari Catalunya</a> that “the delimitation of the protection zone applied to Roc de Rombau is very restrictive, to the point that it could affect some climbing routes considered important.”</p>\n<p>Durand, who runs a climbing guide service in Catalonia, characterized Friday’s meeting as productive and comforting. “[The Department of Culture] clarified that there’s no ban on climbing,” he said, “and recognized that as far as they were aware, there hasn’t been any impact from climbers, which was quite reassuring. [The decree] was a bit coincidental in timing, but for them, it was a process that started in 2019.”</p>\n<p>He added that the new rules were not, in fact, a response to damage from <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/oliana-fire/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the 2022 fire</a>, but merely the attempt to conform to UNESCO protections for the rock art. “Unfortunately, in the decree, they had to summarize it in half a page,” he said. In addition, the GPS coordinates in the decree that outlined the restricted zones were incorrect and need to be refreshed.</p>\n<p>Now, Durand, Sharma, Usobiaga, and Fernandez will be a part of the upcoming inspection to get accurate coordinates. “[The Department of Culture officials] just want to make sure the paintings are not in danger—not just that people don’t climb on top of them, but also that there is no rock that could fall on them,” said Durand. He doubted that the rock art would be in danger from any currently bolted routes.</p>\n<p>For now, Oliana’s world-class climbing will remain open and accessible. “It was a good meeting,” he concluded.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/catalonian-department-of-culture-clarifies-climbing-is-not-banned-at-oliana/\">Climbing Not Banned at Oliana, Officials Clarify</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com\">Climbing</a>.</p>"
